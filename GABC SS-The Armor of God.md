# Review
This study we have been talking about the root cause of evil in the world. This is the spiritual war between [[God]] and [[Satan]] in which Satan is attempting to take the glory from God.
Within this war Satan is attempting to make us all prisoners of war. Key structures that he uses is Fortresses of a deep seated thought that leads a believer to hopelessness and the lofty idea or partition which is a division between the "holy" and "unholy" side of peoples life.
We have furthermore covered the victory we have in [[../30-Spiritual/33-Resources/33.10-People/ðŸ‘¼Jesus|ðŸ‘¼Jesus]] as co-conquerors and the nature of our need to be in a local physical body (ie church).

# Today
Todays study is targeting the [[Armor of God]] and doing a deep dive into it.

## Not Your Armor
The first key is that this armor is not called "The Armor of a Christian" or "Your Armor" it is called "The Armor of God" for a reason. It highlights the fact that we are not the "main character" of this war, the battle is the Lords.[^note1] We are further called to be strong in "the Lord" not ourselves not in some other power, out strength for Spiritual Warfare comes from God. [^b1]
If we look further in Scripture we find that this amor is in and of itself Jesus. [^b2]

[^note1]: **Note**:Yes the book puts the title in the book
[^b1]: [[Ephes 6|Ephes 6:10-20]] - This verse provides us with the Title of the Armor of God. Which we are called to put on. Furthermore this is where we get the command to be strong in the Lord. Then we have the full armor of God.
[^b2]: [[Rom 13|Rom 13:11-14]] - This passage calls us to put on the armor of light, that is to put on Jesus. This also allows us to fight off the flesh. **Note**: for a future study I think it would be useful to integrate this passages call deeper in as it also calls out that we should not live in sin and that Jesus gives us the strength to live away from sin.

## Suit Up
Now we are going to deep dive into the Spiritual warfare it is important to remember that Paul was using the concepts of the Roman Armor.

### The Belt of Truth
Our First piece of armor is the belt of Truth [^b1]. T he belt is what keeps the whole outfit together. If we were to use a house rather than armor as our analogy the Truth would be the foundation. This is also *what* Satan will attack the most (remember he is in fact the father of lies). When it comes to Spiritual Authority, for Christians our Authority can only operate in the truth. Returning back to this we find that this is still a call to put on Christ because Jesus is the truth [^b3].

[^b3]: [[John 14|John 14:6-7]] - In this passage Jesus make the claim of being the way, truth, life and only way to God.

### The Breastplate of Righteousness
The purpose of the roman Breastplate [^b1] was mostly to protect the ribcage area. The heart  of the solider. This piece of armor is a component of us being saved. Because Jesus' righteousness is placed up on us. This is one of two pieces of Armor that a Christian cannot *take off* but rather we are only righteous through Christ. This is a concept known as [[Total Depravity]]. 
The point here is that Satan cannot take your heart. That is fully protected by Christ.

### The Boots of the Gospel of Peace
The Boots of the Gospel of Peace [^b1] though a mouthful honestly has a lot of depth.
First lets look at the Roman Cleats which had "nubs" designed to lock further into the ground allowing them to have a strong footing.
The Gospel is the "Good News" that is the literal translation, so to the readers they would read this as the Boots of the Good News of Peace. So we in fact have knowledge of peace and we have that good news which we can stand in.
The peace [[ðŸ§‘Paul]] is talking about here is Probably the peace from earlier in the letter, that being Jesus [^b4].
Thus we could also calls this the Boots of the Good News of Christ

[^b4]: [[Ephes 2|Ephes 2:14]] - In this verse Jesus is called our peace.

### The Shield Of Faith
The shield of Faith [^b1] we have hit heavily before but in essence the Roman shield was a the primary method that warriors would form a Phalanx and attack the enemy while keeping the whole unit safe. In Spiritual Warfare Faith is what protects us from  attack. An example is the idea that "This is Foolish" there are several examples throughout scripture where God calls someone to do something that appears foolish, but when they acted *in faith* they were healed, had a victory etc.
But faith must be in something, that is for us a s Christians Jesus.

### The Helmet of Salvation [^b1]
Obviously the purpose of a helmet is to protect the brain. No different for the helmet of salvation.  

## Put on Christ

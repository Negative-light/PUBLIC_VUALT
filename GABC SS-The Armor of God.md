# Review
This study we have been talking about the root cause of evil in the world. This is the spiritual war between [[God]] and [[Satan]] in which Satan is attempting to take the glory from God.
Within this war Satan is attempting to make us all prisoners of war. Key structures that he uses is Fortresses of a deep seated thought that leads a believer to hopelessness and the lofty idea or partition which is a division between the "holy" and "unholy" side of peoples life.
We have furthermore covered the victory we have in [[../30-Spiritual/33-Resources/33.10-People/ðŸ‘¼Jesus|ðŸ‘¼Jesus]] as co-conquerors and the nature of our need to be in a local physical body (ie church).

# Today
Todays study is targeting the [[Armor of God]] and doing a deep dive into it.

## Not Your Armor
The first key is that this armor is not called "The Armor of a Christian" or "Your Armor" it is called "The Armor of God" for a reason. It highlights the fact that we are not the "main character" of this war, the battle is the Lords.[^note1] We are further called to be strong in "the Lord" not ourselves not in some other power, out strength for Spiritual Warfare comes from God. [^b1]
If we look further in Scripture we find that this amor is in and of itself Jesus. [^b2]

[^note1]: **Note**:Yes the book puts the title in the book
[^b1]: [[Ephes 6|Ephes 6:10-11]] - This verse provides us with the Title of the Armor of God. Which we are called to put on. Furthermore this is where we get the command to be strong in the Lord
[^b2]: [[Rom 13|Rom 13:11-14]] - This passage calls us to put on the armor of light, that is to put on Jesus. This also allows us to fight off the flesh. **Note**: for a future study I think it would be useful to integrate this passages call deeper in as it also calls out that we should not live in sin and that Jesus gives us the strength to live away from sin.

## Suit Up
Now we are going to deep dive into the Spiritual warfare it is important to remeber that Paul ua

# Review
Last week we did a short introduction into angles but here is what we know so far
- We are in a Spiritual War
- Our enemy is Satan and his goal is to take the Glory of God
- We are equipped with the [[Armor of God]]

# Today
Our focus today will be on the battle field.

In a normal battle field you have battle fronts for example in World War 2 had 10 fronts, the African, Middle Eastern, Mediterranean, Western, Atlantic, Eastern, Indian, Pacific, China and Southeast Asia front [^1]. Within the battle fronts there were various battle lines where the Allies or the Axis gained/lost ground.  In essence a Battle Front is "the war" and a battle line is just "the battle".  Additionally what defines World War 2 is the new weaponry. This includes the nuclear weapons, the start of electronic warfare and tank based warfare.

Similarly Spiritual Warfare has battle fronts, battle lines and a unique set of weapons and strategies used that define the war.

> [!NOTE]
> It is important to check the footnotes of this study as there are some clarifications included in them.

## Weaponry
Lets start with focusing on the weapons that you are likely too see being used. Note that these are not guns, or swords by more or less methodologies, or attempts used by Satan against us.

### Bad Questions
In [[30-Spiritual/BIBLE_CSB_MD/Genesis/Gen 3|Gen 3]] we have the fall of man. This is all precipitated via a question that the serpent (which we assume to be Satan) asks "Did God Really Say". Questions like this can be dangerous. But it is important too realize a few things.
1. Asking Questions is not actually bad, rather it is the type of question and the intention behind it.
    1. This question focuses on the *one* no that [[God]] had given this whole time
        - This type of questioning is actually a common method that Satan uses against us. This is basically focusing on the prohibitions that God has set for us rather than the freedom he gives us. An example from the book is the rule "Thou Shalt Not Covet" is really God also saying you are free to enjoy all the things you rightly earn.
    2. This question starts with assumptions that [[God]] is not looking out for us.
2. The goal here is to get us to look at God in a negative light and or down play the goodness of God (therefore also bringing supposed glory to the individual who enlightened us to this alleged factoid). 

Like all weapons there is a good counter for this one.
1. Thankfulness [[30-Spiritual/BIBLE_CSB_MD/Philippians/Phil 4#6|Phil 4:6]]
2. Study [[30-Spiritual/BIBLE_CSB_MD/2 Timothy/2 Tim 2#15|2 Tim 2:15]]
3. Prayer [[30-Spiritual/BIBLE_CSB_MD/James/James 1#5|James 1:5-8]]

### Twisted Truths
A commonality of cults or those that have misused the church and made it into a weapon is that they will twist the words of Scripture and use it for great evil. If we return too [[30-Spiritual/BIBLE_CSB_MD/Genesis/Gen 3|Gen 3]] we will see that Satan does the same thing. It is importnat to note that we are human and sometimes a truth just gets twisted in communication and may not be intentional, but when it comes to what God says it is important to resync frequently. The following comes from a summary of 

First we should look at Eve's words here. She alters the command of God in three areas.
1. She does not use the term freely. This is important because God has clearly marked that you may consume too your hearts content on the whole of the Garden.
2. She adds a term to the command that one should not touch the tree. This is the first case of legalism we can find in the Bible. 
3. She lessens the punishment of God into a probability. This is to say see reduced the emphasis on the punishment which is ultimately the vector of attack Satan will use. [^note1]

> [!WARNING]
> There is this belief that Eve was the one who caused us to fall into in. This ignores two key details.
> 1. Adam is the one who was supposed to tell Eve of the curse so these twists may have originated with him
> 2. Adam was present with Eve **AND DID NOTHING**. Further making him responsible just as well.
### Blatant Contradiction
The killing weapon of Satan is the he will outright build up contradictions of Scripture that *appear* too be from scripture itself. This weapon often is used in conjunction with Twisted Truths such that it more firmly locks in.

In [[30-Spiritual/BIBLE_CSB_MD/Genesis/Gen 3|Gen 3]] this is when the serpent says "You surely shall not die"


[^1]: [List of World War II battles - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_World_War_II_battles)
[^note1]: I do not necessarily agree with this and further analysis of the phrasing in Hebrew needs to be conducted. 
  This being said the term translated *certainly* in [[30-Spiritual/BIBLE_CSB_MD/Genesis/Gen 1|Gen 1]] is not present in [[30-Spiritual/BIBLE_CSB_MD/Genesis/Gen 3|Gen 3]]

## The Battle Fronts
Obviously there are differently levels for this battles and we are going to start with the general fronts.

### The Individual
All throughout scripture the devils attack is made clearly against a individual. A common one is [[30-Spiritual/BIBLE_CSB_MD/1 Peter/1 Pet 5#8|1 Pet 5:8]]. The goal here is too capture individual Christians such that we cannot operate effectively on other fronts. Failure here may result in you becoming a "POW" too addictions such as porn, alchole, drugs, gossip or glutony. Like what 1 Peter says, the goal is too consume the individual. This being said it is important too consider that although this front is over *one* person it shouldn't be fought by *one* person.

This battle front is used too create leverage on all other battle fronts.
### The Family
In war the best targets are factories. This is because by dealing *one* factory you prevent *thousands* of future weapons. 
This is effectively why Satan desires too attack  the family though things like abuse, divorce and a lack too internally disciple. This results in a whole generation of a family too be lost and creates a lot of damage that takes generations too fix. 

> We must fight for the family because whoever controls the family controls the future.
\- Tony Evans "The Battle is the Lords" pg 73
### The Church
Second too a factory is the training grounds and strategic military bases. In the spiritual world these are the churches. The primary attack here is contention within the church. Almost every epistle is targeting *this* one issue. The goal is too divide us over superficial lines, in the including but not limited race, politics, and sub-cultures. One issue is that there is a distinction between being a "member" of a church body and having fellowship with another group of Christians. Although we may not agree with the Pentecostals on all things it doesn't mean we shouldn't fellowship with them and when we do something over a whole city, county, state or the nation does not mean we shouldn't invite them [^note2]. Ultiatmly we should seek too "Preserve the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace" ^[[[../30-Spiritual/BIBLE_CSB_MD/Ephesians/Ephes 4#3|Ephes 4:3]]]

> One reason the churches have not come together is that we are not very good about making the distinction between membership and fellowship.
\- Tony Evans "The Battle is the Lord" pg 74

The church operates as a army and this comes back to the concept of the [[Armor of God]], specifically the Shield. The shield discussed is the roman shield (Shown Below) was dignied to give the full army a shell due to its interlocking design [^2] allowing the whole army to protect eachother better than one individual can, similar we are called to protect each other from the blows of Satan [^b1].

![Roman Scuta|100](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Ag-obj-5959-001-pub-large.jpg/800px-Ag-obj-5959-001-pub-large.jpg)


[^note2]: Although Pentecostals are called out here, this is for the sake of the people this is presented too, this applies across all denominations.
   There are somethings we must be in agreeance with (these are the primary issues of salvation, the nature of God and the nature of man) most of the differences between Baptists, Southern Baptists, Pentecostals, Lutherans, Methodists, Anglicans, Orthodox and some branches of Catholics are minor details when compared too the [[Great Commission ]].
[^2]:  [Scutum - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scutum)
[^b1]: [[Gal 6|Gal 6:1-10]] Discuses Christians lifting each others burdens and carrying them as one. Specifically this is talking about those who are caught in sin. 
  [[Heb 10|Heb 10:24-25]] - This passage discuses Christians encouraging each other, making sure to meet and build each other in love and good works.
### The Society
In [[../30-Spiritual/BIBLE_CSB_MD/Daniel/Dan 10|Dan 10]], Daniel gets a vision in which the angle [[ðŸ§‘Gabriel]] meets Daniel, but he is stopped by the "Prince of the Kingdom of Persia" until [[ðŸ§‘ Michael]] comes and saves him. This passage shows a lot about spiritual warfare we will hit on later. But one thing is that Satan works within bodies of society including Government, Organizations and/or Movements. Ultimately the goal here is the support the Induvial front and take as many 

## The Battles
So first we are going to look at a bit of strategy that Paul discusses in [[../30-Spiritual/BIBLE_CSB_MD/2 Corinthians/2 Cor 10#3|2 Cor 10:3-5]]. Satan tries to convince us that we need to follow through with secular things too fill spiritual needs. If you have an addiction the truth of the matter is that although there is a physiological issue present it is a symptom of a spiritual need. This is why it is important too encourage healing through **Christ Alone** too addicts, rather than just phycological tricks and tips [^note3].

[^note3]: Note that just like it is important to treat the symptoms of a infection, it is also important to treat the physical symptoms of spiritual sickness.
  This is to say that although we should preach **Christ Alone**, we should also provide tips, tricks hints and help to assist  brother and sisters in Christ in dealing with their spiritual/physical issues.
### Mental Fortresses
On the individual front Satan desires too build a "fortress" in everyone's mind this obviously needs a detention.


> [!IMPORTANT] Fortress Definition
> a mind-set that holds you hostage, making you believe that you are locked into a hopeless situation that you are powerless to change.
\- Tony Evans "The Battle is the Lords" pg 77

This is ultimately how Satan makes Christians a POW. These can be subtle like ("I can't work with Kids") or glaringly obvious ("I can't defeat my __X__ addition"). This is a byproduct of Satan basicly making himself a little house inside your head whispering into your mind continuously lies.


### Partitions
In line with this is Satan putting up walls under the goal of making us "double minded"., These specifically are mentioned in [[../30-Spiritual/BIBLE_CSB_MD/2 Corinthians/2 Cor 10#5|2 Cor 10:5]]. Basically making a "Holy" side of your mind and a "Unholy" side of your mind. [^note4]. A clear sign of having a partition is that what you hear on a Sunday Morning (or in your daily bible studies) isn't finding its way into your every day life. This results in becoming a confused warrior that cannot tell who the enemy is.

[^note4]: A Good analogy for this is the land of Mordor which has a fortress called Barad-dÃ»r, and the Black Gate which operates as a wall too prevent the "Good things" from entering the corrupted land of Mordor allowing Sauron
### Counterattacks
As a church we know that these types of things exist and we may call them by different names. 

#### For Fortresses
[[../30-Spiritual/BIBLE_CSB_MD/2 Corinthians/2 Cor 10#4|2 Cor 10:4]] describes our methods of defeating a fortress
- Prayer
- Bible Study
- Obedience
- Biblical Meditation
- Fasting
- Service

As an anecdote one of the best ways in my life too fight depression was serving others and taking care of them. 

#### For Partitions
Partitions are lofty ideas or speculations that are contrary to what God says. The primary way to prevent/destroy a partition is the idea of "Thought Claiming" ^[[[../30-Spiritual/BIBLE_CSB_MD/2 Corinthians/2 Cor 10#5|2 Cor 10:5]]]. This idea sounds easy and honestly when it comes down to it, once it is habit, is rather easy. This is the thing that Evans clams is a major issue in the church we are "Making the Christian life harder than God makes it" [^source2]. Ultimately the time to a complete time of change in ones life requires a change in ones thinking, this is even admitted within the world of phycology [^source1].

#### For All Things
- Get your order from God. This is done by asking for wisdom in faith. ^[[[../30-Spiritual/BIBLE_CSB_MD/James/James 1#5|James 1:5]]].
    - Note that you should focus on *what God says*. Otherwise you risk acting as double minded going the way God and Man both are pulling you.
- Get close too God. ^[[[../30-Spiritual/BIBLE_CSB_MD/James/James 4#8|James 4:8]]]
    - As mentioned above, you do not have a issue with the obvious things. Alcoholism, Addiction etc are not the problem they are the symptom.  Ultimately as you get close too God, God comes closer too you and where God resides sin cannot exist.
- Get the right view of Sin ^[[[../30-Spiritual/BIBLE_CSB_MD/James/James 4#9|James 4:9-10]]]
    - We you need too see your sin as God sees it and understand our Total depravity. This also results in God coming closer too you. ^[[[../30-Spiritual/BIBLE_CSB_MD/Psalms/Ps 34#18|Ps 34:18]], [[../30-Spiritual/BIBLE_CSB_MD/Psalms/Ps 51#17|Ps 51:17]]]
- Get on your knees
    - Specifically it is advised too pray Scripture itself.
    - This can operate as the sledgehammer too destroy walls

# Review
Last week we did a short introduction into angles but here is what we know so far
- We are in a Spiritual War
- Our enemy is Satan and his goal is to take the Glory of God
- We are equipped with the [[Armor of God]]

# Today
Our focus today will be on the battle field.

> [!NOTE] Last Weeks Lesson was done early
> I accidentally skipped two chapters. This is kinda a catchup lesson

In a normal battle field you have battle fronts for example in World War 2 had 10 fronts, the African, Middle Eastern, Mediterranean, Western, Atlantic, Eastern, Indian, Pacific, China and Southeast Asia front [^1]. Within the battle fronts there were various battle lines where the Allies or the Axis gained/lost ground.  In essence a Battle Front is "the war" and a battle line is just "the battle".  Additionally what defines World War 2 is the new weaponry. This includes the nuclear weapons, the start of electronic warfare and tank based warfare.

Similarly Spiritual Warfare has battle fronts, battle lines and a unique set of weapons and strategies used that define the war.

## Weaponry
Lets start with focusing on the weapons that you are likly too see being used. Note that these are not guns, or swords by more or less methodologies, or attempts used by Satan against us.

### Bad Questions
In [[30-Spiritual/BIBLE_CSB_MD/Genesis/Gen 3|Gen 3]] we have the fall of man. This is all precipitated via a question that the serpent (which we assume to be Satan) asks "Did God Really Say". Questions like this can be dangerous. But it is important too realize a few things.
1. Asking Questions is not actually bad, rather it is the type of question and the intention behind it.
    1. This question focuses on the *one* no that [[God]] had given this whole time
        - This type of questioning is actually a common method that Satan uses against us. This is basically focusing on the prohibitions that God has set for us rather than the freedom he gives us. An example from the book is the rule "Thou Shalt Not Covet" is really God also saying you are free to enjoy all the things you rightly earn.
    2. This question starts with assumptions that [[God]] is not looking out for us.
2. The goal here is to get us to look at God in a negative light and or down play the goodness of God (therefore also bringing supposed glory to the individual who enlightened us to this alleged factoid). 

Like all weapons there is a good counter for this one.
1. Thankfulness [[30-Spiritual/BIBLE_CSB_MD/Philippians/Phil 4#6|Phil 4:6]]
2. Study [[30-Spiritual/BIBLE_CSB_MD/2 Timothy/2 Tim 2#15|2 Tim 2:15]]
3. Prayer [[30-Spiritual/BIBLE_CSB_MD/James/James 1#5|James 1:5-8]]

### Twisted Truths
A commonality of cults or those that have misused the church and made it into a weapon is that they will twist the words of Scripture and use it for great evil. If we return too [[30-Spiritual/BIBLE_CSB_MD/Genesis/Gen 3|Gen 3]] we will see that Satan does the same thing.

First we should look at Eve's words here. She alters the command of God in three areas.
1. She does not use the term freely. This is important because God has clearly marked that you may consume too your hearts content on the whole of the Garden.
2. She adds a term to the command that one should not touch the tree. This is the first case of legalism we can find in the Bible. 
3. She lessens the punishment of God into a probability. [^note1]

### Blatant Contradiction
The killing weapon of Satan is the he will outright build up contradictions of Scripture that *appear* too be from scripture itself. This weapon often is used in conjunction with Twisted Truths such that it more firmly locks in.

In [[30-Spiritual/BIBLE_CSB_MD/Genesis/Gen 3|Gen 3]] this is when the serpent says "You surely shall not die"


[^1]: [List of World War II battles - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_World_War_II_battles)
[^note1]: I do not necessarily agree with this and further analysis of the phrasing in Hebrew needs to be conducted. 
  This being said the term translated *certainly* in [[30-Spiritual/BIBLE_CSB_MD/Genesis/Gen 1|Gen 1]] is not present in [[30-Spiritual/BIBLE_CSB_MD/Genesis/Gen 3|Gen 3]]

## The Battle Fronts
Obviously there are differently levels for this battles and we are going to start with the general fronts.

### The Individual
All throughout scripture the devils attack is made clearly against a individual. A common one is [[30-Spiritual/BIBLE_CSB_MD/1 Peter/1 Pet 5#8|1 Pet 5:8]]. The goal here is too capture individual Christians such that we cannot operate effectively on other fronts. Failure here may result in you becoming a "POW" too addictions such as porn, alchole, drugs, gossip or glutony. Like what 1 Peter says, the goal is too consume the individual. This being said it is important too consider that although this front is over *one* person it shouldn't be fought by *one* person.

This battle front is used too create leverage on all other battle fronts.
### The Family
In war the best targets are factories. This is because by dealing *one* factory you prevent *thousands* of future weapons. 
This is effectively why Satan desires too attack  the family though things like abuse, divorce and a lack too internally disciple. This results in a whole generation of a family too be lost and creates a lot of damage that takes generations too fix. 

> We must fight for the family because whoever controls the family controls the future.
\- Tony Evans "The Battle is the Lords" pg 73
### The Church
Second too a factory is the training grounds and strategic military bases. In the spiritual world these are the churches.
### The Society

# Last Week
Last week we see [God](God.md) warn the people of the [Southern Kingdom](Southern%20Kingdom.md) against false prophets, calling them his enemies. Now this wasn't my best lesson because I had been ill, that shouldn't be the case this week.

But I wanted to continue the discussion.
1. In the last week have you heard things, about yourself, about our church what are things you have been told or messages you have received?


# This Week

This week we are gonna have to start with a bit of a word exploration. This passage talks about the burden of God and how those who mention it God will throw off [^1].

## What is Burden
The word used here is [massa'](strongs-h4853.md) which has several definitions. This includes a burden, the word of carrying luggage, a prophecy of doom, or a mental desire.

So I am going to give you this definition that blends the three.

> A heavy hearted prophetic song of one facing destruction

This type of song is one that the artist has burdened over, when played it weighs them down as if the pianist is wearing a coat of lead. It is heartfelt, sensitive and deep.

This definition comes with the figurative definitions that i feel align with this passage. Which does seem to use this word as a clever devise to using both the literal definition of the word and the figurative case [^garner-howes], it also may be used to call out how people would mock the true prophecies of the time [^matthew-henry]
## What is this Burden
So now we need to evaluate what exactly is this burden. It is the people, the very ones that would ask [Jeremiah](p-jeremiah.md) "What is the burden of the Lord?". This coming out of the last part of verse 33, sometimes that last bit can be translated as You are the burden rather than the question What is the burden. 

Furthermore this plays on how the false prophets were misusing the terms [^ellicott]. This usage of the term created persecution via mockery [^matthew-henry], creating noise that prevents the signal of Jeremiah's message from coming through.  

## What you say is your Burden
So we later see God say that what a man says is his own burden. Which i find interesting. One thing I have often been convicted of is negative self talk. And this concept is why. The way we talk about ourselves, our church, the people around us creates micro adjustments in the directions we go, the way we act etc. These 1% changes extrapolate over time to the point that your identify becomes what you say you are. When you fall under this you become weighed down by it.

The fact is that our words have power, and the bible warns about it many times [^2]

It is important to note that this could also be applying to the false prophets who's words were becoming the pronouncement of judgement upon themselves [^garner-howes]. Furthermore this was used as a mocking phrase of "what's the bad news today buddy" [^john-gill] basically the people had become numb to the word and were now just annoyed with Jeremiah [^matthew-poole]. A sign of peoples hatred of God at that point [^john-calvin].
## Judgment
God has also clearly throughout this passage described that these people who are curious are going to be judged, thrown out and humiliated. Their families disgraced (a common theme of the judgments pronounced by Jeremiah). This judgment comes with the idea of god himself throwing off the burden.

This is a show of absolute disgrace [^enduring-word]. They were to be treated like trash.
## Application/Discussion
1. What are the burdens that the pastors of our church are facing?
    1. The bad history and blood in our church
    2. The numbness of our body. OF OURSELVES
2. Is there something your holding onto holding you back?
    1. The idea comes form the run your race verse set where Paul calls believers to throw off anything that holds us back from rightness. Are we there
3. What ways have we, both as a church and individually ignored the truth of God? How have we dishonored or mistreated God's word? How do we trivialize God?
4. Do we over spiritualize our langue?
    1. This comes form the idea in Ellicott's commentary of our words becoming cant or useless and unmeaning?
    2. Do we overload our discusions with Jargon?
# Next Week
We are gonna hope to chapter 24 which we will decently finish.

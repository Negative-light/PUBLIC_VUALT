# Review
This study has covered the spiritual war between [[God]] and Satan over Glory. We have discussed the different spaces Satan attempt to attack, the units on both God's side and Satan's. Last week we covered how we find victory in [[../30-Spiritual/33-Resources/33.10-People/👼Jesus|👼Jesus]] over Satan

# Today
This week we start the practical application for this study, primarily we are going to understand *authority* as this is a principle element to spiritual warfare [^note1]. We are going to focus more on the practical things and as always with this study I suggest you read the accompanying book.

[^note1]: *Note*: this idea comes from pg 225 of the book that authority is *power* within Spiritual warfare. I do think that is a bit of a simplification but overall is still true

## The Source for Authority
For us the source of Authority is Jesus. That is obviously the point of the whole point of this study. But is there more to this not really. We are called to rely on Jesus for everything and this comes by getting to know him [^b1].

[^b1]: [[Acts 17|Acts 17:24-31]] - This is a excerpt from [[🧑Paul]]'s presentation to the men on the [[🏠Areopagus]]. This is focused on how we are called to find everything in God and this comes by seeking him.

### Jesus Defeated Satan's Weapon
One thing to consider is that Satan's primary weapon is death and Jesus defeated death. This is why the resurrection is so important. It results in Satan not only having less authority but has no weapon to work with. [^b1a]

[^b1a]: [[Heb 2|Heb 2:14]] - this verse is a short commentary on Jesus coming in the flesh and to destroy Satan *because* Satan had the power of death.
 
### Jesus Paid our Debts
Another core thing with Authority is that Jesus  paid our debt when he died on the cross. We are no longer chained to the debts of our sin as those have been taken by Jesus when he finished the work [^b2].

[^b2]: [[John 19|John 19:30]] - This verse is the last statement of the [[Crucifixion of Jesus]] when he says "It is Finished" the word *Finished* could also mean *Paid in Full*. 

### Jesus has all authority
Jesus furthermore has authority of all things in heaven and on earth via his death burial and resurrection [^b2a]. 

[^b2a]: [[Matt 28|Matt 28:18]] - This verse is a opening statement of Jesus as he presents himself post resurrection to the disciples. Stating that all authority has been given to him on heaven and on earth.

## Our Current Position

> We have powerful Christians living powerless lives because they keep looking to Satan for permission to live as Christians
\- Tony Evans *The Battle is the Lords* pg 235

We as Christian *must* understand our actual position and the authority we have simply being followers of Jesus. This is huge as many Christians ignore this and get stuck in Sin struggles. We have the authority the right to be sanctified through the [[Holy Spirit]], this being said of course there are some sins we are also commanded to flee from.

### Co-Conquerors

When Jesus defeated Satan the word used there is similar to how a Roman Conqueror would triumph [^b3]. In this he would take the enemy general chain him behind his chariot and ride through the city along with his army thereafter. We are that army for Jesus.

[^b3]: [[Col 2|Col 2:15]] - This  is a verse that highlights Christ's triumph and demonstration of his authority.

## Exercising Authority
Ok so we have authority we have a position cool. But position only matters based on who you are under. In highschool I became the First Officer of the local Trail Life toop. In that position i had authority and reasonability. This being said the troop eventually closed. So do I still have that Authority, **NO**. Authority only matters from whom you get it from, as Christians this is from Jesus. Similar to how a police officer puts on a uniform we should put on the clothing of Christ to exercise our authority.

## Victory In Christ

In closing we have victory and authority in Christ ultimately to live in the *Promised Land* that is the Christian Life. So that one day we can be also with God in paradise.

# Next Week
We are going to dive deeper on using our authority.

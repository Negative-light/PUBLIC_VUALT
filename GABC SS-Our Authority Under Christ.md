# Review
This study has covered the spiritual war between [[God]] and Satan over Glory. We have discussed the different spaces Satan attempt to attack, the units on both God's side and Satan's. Last week we covered how we find victory in [[../30-Spiritual/33-Resources/33.10-People/üëºJesus|üëºJesus]] over Satan

# Today
This week we start the practical application for this study, primarily we are going to understand *authority* as this is a principle element to spiritual warfare [^note1]. We are going to focus more on the practical things and as always with this study I suggest you read the accompanying book.

[^note1]: *Note*: this idea comes from pg 225 of the book that authority is *power* within Spiritual warfare. I do think that is a bit of a simplification but overall is still true

## The Source for Authority
For us the source of Authority is Jesus. That is obviously the point of the whole point of this study. But is there more to this not really. We are called to rely on Jesus for everything and this comes by getting to know him [^b1].

[^b1]: [[Acts 17|Acts 17:24-31]] - This is a excerpt from [[üßëPaul]]'s presentation to the men on the [[üè†Areopagus]]. This is focused on how we are called to find everything in God and this comes by seeking him.

### Jesus Defeated Satan's Weapon
One thing to consider is that Satan's primary weapon is death and Jesus defeated death. This is why the resurrection is so important. It results in Satan not only having less authority but has no weapon to work with. [^b1a]

[^b1a]: [[Heb 2|Heb 2:14]] - this verse is a short commentary on Jesus coming in the flesh and to destroy Satan *because* Satan had the power of death.
 
### Jesus Paid our Debts
Another core thing with Authority is that Jesus  paid our debt when he died on the cross. We are no longer chained to the debts of our sin as those have been taken by Jesus when he finished the work [^b2].

[^b2]: [[John 19|John 19:30]] - This verse is the last statement of the [[Crucifixion of Jesus]] when he says "It is Finished" the word *Finished* could also mean *Paid in Full*.

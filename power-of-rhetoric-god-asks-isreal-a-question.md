# Last Week
Last week we looked at the false teachers [Israel](../p-nation-of-israel.md) that they will not be judged by [God](God.md). [ðŸ§‘Jeremiah](%F0%9F%A7%91Jeremiah.md) specifically calls out how to handle this situation. This brought us to question a few things
1. Do we listen to people who convict us?
2. Do we correct those who lead us when what they say denies the word of God

This week we are going to see further judgment on Israel but we are going to be focusing on some questions that God brings to Israel. What they make us thing and how we can use them as Christians.

## Opening
We are starting with some context that God is bring this judgment specifically because of what the son of [ðŸ§‘Hezekiah](%F0%9F%A7%91Hezekiah.md) ([ðŸ§‘Manasseh son of Hezekiah](%F0%9F%A7%91Manasseh%20son%20of%20Hezekiah.md)). [^m1] 
The situation that the two intercessors of Israel ([ðŸ§‘Moses](%F0%9F%A7%91Moses.md) and [[ðŸ§‘Samuel]] interceded for the nation [^b1]) wouldn't be able to intercede for the nation [^enduring-word] [^matthew-poole]. 
God then describes the nature of the destruction He is sending (sword, famine and captivity) this read to me more as through groupos of people those who would die, those you would starve and those who would be captives (like [ðŸ§‘Daniel](%F0%9F%A7%91Daniel.md)). 
Some commentaries see this as the progression of the judgment that is that there will be death, suffering and exile [^ellicott].
The thing is that the people are not just being killed they are being desecrated [^guzik].


[^b1]: [Ps 99](Ps%2099.md), [Exod 32](Exod%2032.md), [Num 14](Num%2014.md), [1 Sam 7](1%20Sam%207.md)

## The Judgment
Here we have God now calling out to Israel in a prophecy starting with rhetorical questions to force them to think. Who would they be without Him [^1]. This idea is a part of Lamentations too [^john-gill]. Overall this is the full and final judgment on Israel.


## Applications
The point here is that the problem we have here is a "fate worse than death" if we are disobedient to God [^2]. Do you live a life abandoned from God.

# Next Week
We are gonna to look at the burned of the prophet. This is inspried some by a sermon I found [^2] that I suggest you look at.

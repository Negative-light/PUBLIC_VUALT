# Last Week
So last week we reviewed an object lesson where [[God]] presented two sets of figs to [[p-jeremiah|Jeremiah]].
The good figs represent the people who were exiled to [[🏙️Babylon|Babylon]] and the bad represents the people left in [[city-jerusalem|Jerusalem]]. 
This lesson had a focus on the idea that those who are blessed by God might not be the ones who look that way and for us to not take for granted the relationship we have with God. This of course has several relationships within scripture such as how in the end times Christ will separate between the sheep and goats.

# This Week
Ok so this week we are actually going back in time slightly to just at the start of [[🧑Jehoiakim|Jehoiakim]].  Where Jeremiah gets a specific prophecy of the now oncoming invasion from [[🧑Nebuchadnezzar|Nebuchadnezzar]].

## Context
Ok so this chapter gives us some important context that it happens in the 4th year of Jehoiakim (aka Jeconiah) and the 1st year of Nebuchadnezzar. Mind that this was the first year that Nebuchadnezzar was the sole ruler of Babylon, he was actually crowned king before this but was ruling with his father [^john-calvin] This would have been around 605 BC where Babylon would defeat Egypt. This would remove the primary seat of power from [[📌Assyria|Assyria]] and make it Babylon. This would be like a major upset in a national election, everyone is now wondering how the world is going to work moving forward [^thomas-constable]. 

Furthermore we have to note that at least three prophets were active during this time [[🧑Uriah|Uriah]], [[🧑Zephaniah son of Cush|Zephaniah]] and [[🧑Habakkuk|Habakkuk]]. 

## A Reminder of Jeremiah's Ministry
Our first section Jeremiah gives a not of his ministry from the reign of [[🧑Josiah|Josiah]] to the modern day this included covering that he continually preached repentance [^1] In this section we get a clear highlight that God was given more than enough opportunities for the people to repent but they refused to obey time and time again for 23 years. This was 23 years of attempted revival. 23 years of having street preachers give a message of repentance without fail, but with no one turning to God. This significance also would have shown *why* the punishment was so high because 23years of refusal means there is no excuse for having no attempt to repent [^matthew-henry] [^thomas-constable]. 

I like how Calvin put the state of Jeremiah's ministry.

## The Judgement
Our second section covers the judgment that God is going to have including a 70 year exile (which we know is kept) [^2]. At this point the exile was a inevitable judgment because the nation refused to obey God [^garner-howes]. The oncoming horrors would be utter desaturation for Judah and eventually description of Babylon [^matthew-poole].

### Judgement to Judah
The Judgment for Judah was first obviously the invasion, but this was not a simple invasion it was a desaturation of their cities, removal of the ability to feel and sense joy. The imagery used was the common life celebration such as weddings and the sounds of normal life would just stop [^enduring-word]. 

But in this we even see God's grace because we see for the first time the 70 year exile directly mentioned [^ellicott]. The people knew this judgment had a timer, they could tell their children and grandchildren that they would return such that their grandchildren might see Israel rebuilt. Note that life expectancy typically was between 30 and 40 years so the generation alive in Israel would not return at all [^3]. This functioned as a form of comfort for the people as well which was greatly nice [^matthew-henry].

A second element is to understand the significance of this time figure. It was make up for the land Sabbaths that Judah weren't following every 7 years for ~490 years [^garner-howes] [^4]. This is also a symbolized number for the "highest measure of completeness" [^ellicott]. 

Another note is that God's sovereignty is being shown here in that someone who doesn't know God and may even hate him is being actively used for God's purposes [^john-gill]. This ties in to a whole free will paradox which may be a fruitful discussion and I maybe we can dive into that ourselves.

### Judgment to Babylon
Now this doesn't not mean that God is going to ignore his "servant" Babylon who is also a desperately wicked nation and God would still judge them. The idea of God using the wicked as a tool of judgment is even mentioned in the New Testament where [[🧑Paul|Paul]] requests the Corinthians to pray a man over to Satan for incest [^5]. In both cases God uses a known evil to judge but doesn't ignore the fact that the evil entity will be judged.

Unlike the judgment on Israel this one doesn't come with a promise of return. Babylon would be fully destroyed (taken over by the Medo-Persian Empire) with no real redemption of that nation. This disciplining tools was created to be destroyed [^garner-howes]. 


## Discussion and Application
The focus of this study for us is that we are the current and future leaders of the Church. Meaning that when we see judgment it is our job to help in the functional parts of corporate repentance.

- *Patience*: One element we need to consider here is that Jeremiah was leading for 23 years. During that time he saw no change no alterations. We all see the issues in the heart and habits of our nation, or the church etc. we as leaders must be willing to continue in obedience even when the world around us is resistant to the change.
    - Provide an example area in the systems around you that you see this type of problem.
    - *1% Improvement*: The best and most natural way to improve your state in life is to make minor changes to habits and environment. These 1% changes actually stack rapidly. For more information i suggest reading [[atomic-habits|Atomic Habits]]. 
- *The Problem of Evil*: Ok so now we get to see that one reason that evil exists in the world. It is not just our sin but also for the purpose of teaching the righteous. God uses evil people and allows their evil to continue (such as Babylon's idolatry) to teach the righteous and discipline those He loves.
    - What are "evil" systems in place today that are being used to discipline the church?
    - What are systems or structures within our church that God is using to teach us and the evil we are facing today at this church? What are lessons we can corporately learn from this season? What are lessons we could individually take from this season?
- *Prepare for the Return*: Part of this hear is that God wants Judah to remember her former glory. God wants the people to remember it so that when the opportunity to return to that Glory happens there is palatable desire to return to it. There is a desire to worship God like we used to. Now this does not mean that the future glory will be the same as the former.
    - For our church this means that we should remember the "good old days" and it is our responsibility to carry on that memory as our elders pass, but we must also understand the the future of our church may not *directly* map to the past.

# Next Week
We are going to study the cup of God's wrath in Jeremiah 25:15-29.

# Last Week
We discussed the lament of [ðŸ§‘Jeremiah](%F0%9F%A7%91Jeremiah.md) over the unrepentantly foolish nature of [Israell](../p-nation-of-israel.md) refusing healing balm when it is right there. This ties into the grief of [God](God.md) and how [Jesus](../30-Spiritual/33-Resources/33.10-People/%F0%9F%91%BCJesus.md) is the healing balm we need as individuals and as a nation.

## Fountains
This section we see two fountains mentioned, the first for the tears of Jeremiah and the fountain of sin of the people [^m1]. One core element of this section is that Jeremiah desires to flee from Israel because of the judgment coming upon the people. But here is also a call to action for the people to avoid each other because they are all "deceivers" so much so that their tounges have become weapons of war [^john-gill]

### Applications
Do we live in a culture like this?
How can we help prevent problems caused by lying?

## Judgment
Here we see God calling that He will be the refiner of Israel because of their deceitfulness [^m2]. This seems to also tie to [ðŸ§‘Isaiah](%F0%9F%A7%91Isaiah.md) who was called near this timeframe and is known for his "unclean lips" [^b1]. I think that this testing could be treated closer to the "sifting" we see in the modern church. Unlike Israel who seemed to refuse to change [^enduring-word], I think that we are adapting maybe a little clumsily and in some places I think other churches are wandering away from scriptures while other churchs are diving deeper. 

[^b1]: [Isa 1](Isa%201.md)

### Applications
Although it is important to understand judgment on a nation something we often don't consider is "restoration" what are things that have changed for you in the last year that have shown God's restoration of his people?
    For me something small but I think important that I have noticed this year is Christmas lights are up, and more people are using them. I know this seems odd but Christmas lights have almost always been a symbol of the joy of Christmas. 


## God Speaks
This section God starts a rhetorical question of who is wise enough to listen. Calling out that the people have refused to listen to him and follow the Law rather than follow their own hearts and seek [ðŸª¨Baal](%F0%9F%AA%A8Baal.md). This results in God promising stark punishment and removal of his blessings [^m3]. Something important to consider here is that we still in a lament from the previous chapter, this rhetorical question could still be a part of that [^ellicott]. Ultimately this comes from a lack of study into the scripture because people "followed their own way" which means they don't even known that these judgments are the standard from the Law [^matthew-henry].

### Applications
How can when we seek only what pleases us even as Christians can we land into judgment?

What are methods to prevent you from falling to this point?

## The Judgment
This lsast bit is God making clear the judgment that is coming [^m4]. This call to a communal morning but it is morning of those that are not seeking God [^matthew-poole].
# Next Week
We start in Jer 10.

# Review
We are studying the prophecies of [[../p-jeremiah|Jeremiah]] to the southern kingdom of [Israel](../p-nation-of-israel.md). This book highlights how they have abandoned [God](God.md) for idols. this book uses [[adultery-def|adultery]] to highlight that point the most [^connection1].

[^connection1]: This reminds me of [[apostasy-is-adultry|Apostasy is Adultery]], and [[divorce-and-adulatory|divorce-and-adulatory]]

# This Week
This week I wanted to take a step back and look at how Goid is still faithful despite the unfaithfulness of Israel. This is because of his unfailing [Love](love.md).

## Setting the Scene
Most of chapter three covers this theme that God has divorced the people because they were unfaithful to him. This even calls out that someone cannot remarry a woman if they have given her a divorce and she remarries another [^b2]. This here is a call to self reflect [^b1].

[^b1]: [Jer 3:1-12](Jer%203.md) - This section we see God provide a rhetorical question to Israel and a new prophecy to Jeremiah during the reign of [ðŸ§‘Josiah](%F0%9F%A7%91Josiah.md)
[^b2]: [Deut 24:1-4](Deut%2024.md) - this passage includes  the description of some divorce law for Israel

Within this God also highlights that the Northern tribe has already been taken away and completely defiled. Being taken over completely by idols [^b1].

## God Offers Repentance
here I want to take a step back and focus on something small something tiny here but really is huge. Within this next section God mentions that his love doesn't stop of fail.  If the people acknowledge what they have done  and return to him. Knowing they will not immediately [^b3]

[^b3]: [Jer 3:12-13](Jer%203.md) - this passage here we see God calling Israel out.

## Come All
The last section I think is a somewhat end time prophecy mostly due to the latter part of it. Where we see long temr those who repent will berr gathered to God [^b4]

[^b4]: [Jer 3:14-18](Jer%203.md)

## A thought on Repentance
This segment closes with Jeremiah providing some thoughts on repentance. But I think the important part we see here is that God will heal unfaithfulness. All to often we see this call, Get right then come to God. God says the opposite, come to me and I will make you right. God knows what we go through. This is why [jesus](jesus.md) is called to have sympathized with us because God knows the difficulty of life and how hard it is to truly repent [^b5]

[Jer 3:19-25](Jer%203.md)

# Next Week
We focus on how Repentance is importnat

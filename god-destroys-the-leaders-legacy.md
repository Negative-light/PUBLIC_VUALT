# Last Week
Last week in our study of the writings of [p-jeremiah](../p-jeremiah.md) we explored how Israel idolized religion extracting from it this false beliefs that they were safe because they followed through with the actions around the Jewish faith. [God](God.md) highlights that this will not work citing how he judged [üèôÔ∏èShilo](%F0%9F%8F%99%EF%B8%8FShilo.md) even if it was his resting place. Finally we see that God desires people to live in faithful obedience and still is patient with us allowing time to repent.

This chapter has some interesting turns in it. We see that the leadership of [Israel](../p-nation-of-israel.md) is called out for idolatry.

## Desecration of the Dead.
[^b1]: [Rom 1:25](Rom%201.md)

We all respect our dead and that is why in our fist section when God calls for hte leaders of Israel to have their graves desecrated before their idols it is rather important [^m1]. This is a clear highlight of God judging Israel and fully releasing them. The concept of them becoming manure also is kinda a shameful concept [^john-gill] [^matthew-pool].  

On a personal level this made me consider astrology the pseudo-science/religion that is common among people today, including Christians. It is not uncommon in the dating sphere for people to seek "compatible" signs and some people make their sign their personality. Meanwhile if you dig a tiny bit deeper astrology seems to be nothing but generic and empty platitudes that could mean anything to anyone.

The thing is that the leadership of Israel sought signs from the sky, using the cosmic timing system that God created as a replacement for God. It is sad that we do this so often that even the apostle [üßëPaul](%F0%9F%A7%91Paul.md) noticed it and mentioned that we tend to worship the creation rather than the creator [^b1]. As Christians we shouldn't be seeking the sky to tell us what should be done rather we should seek God.

### Applications

How can a long standing sin infect and corrupt your memory?
How has it effected the ministries of others?

Are there examples of how people can be redeemed even after this point?
    The example I am considering here is [üßëDavid](%F0%9F%A7%91David.md).

## Stubbornness in Israel's Rebellion
Our next section is God commanding Jeremiah to talk about how foolish the rebellion of Israel is and how far they have run [^m2]. First I think it is important to consider the history of Israel especially the timeframe recorded in [Judges](Judges.md) where they were in a genearational cycle of falling into sin then being conquered then God sending someone to extract them from captivity. Then we need to consider that hte northern kingdom had *just* been taken not too long ago. But we also should see here also some of the "why", the peoples heart had become callous. Similar to the hard path in the [Parable of the Sower](Parable%20of%20the%20Sower.md).  This whole pattern of Judah at this point defies the "natural order" of how a person would act [^enduring-word] [^guzik] [^ellicott].

### Applications

*Rhetorical*: Do we live in a manner like Israel falling from our sin and refusing to get back up?

Given what we know of God and his graciousness do you thing that he would be against regular repentance?
    NO! He desires it, it is interesting because even in this section the mention to migration highlights that it is normal to fall but it is not normal to fall and refuse to return to God and try to change day by day as we get closer to Him.

## Wisdom Without God
[^b2]: [James 3:1](James%203.md)

Here we see the continuation of Jeremiah's prophecy to the nation, that the people having pretended to be wise because of claims from their leadership are truthfully fools because their leaders lie [^m3]. The leaders are who g et the punishment here with their fields and wives being taken over Here we see something important, if you are a leader God holds you responsible for what and how you treat your people, thus when Israel's leadership shows to be dealing falsely they  are punished doubly so and this applies today [^b2]. Sadly this type of religous leader exists today and will willlingly lie to people for deceitful gain and most are like these scribes cllouse to their sin.

### Applications
DO we have a responsibility to help our leaders line up to what scripture says?

Do we allow are leadership to be truthful in leading us?

## Absolute Desolation
Our final verse though connected to how the leadership is treated really talks about the full and absolute destruction of Israel [^m4]. This means God is removing all of the blessings that He has given them throughout his time. God is depriving them of his greatness because they have rejected him [^matthew-pool]. As Christians this also applies, sin removes the fruit that shows in our life as Christians. Fruit  is a blessing from God something that is both nurousing (good for the body) and delightful (good for the soul). In the Christian walk our fruits bless us and those around us.

### Applications
Have you seen this phenominon in youir life?

What are things keeping you from growing as a Christian?

# Today

Today we are going to look into Satan and his Character. this can be best summarized in his name which means "adversary" or "opposer" [^cite1] and "accuser" or "slanderer" [^cite2]. This really shows that his character is to accuse us before God but remember that [[../30-Spiritual/33-Resources/33.10-People/ðŸ‘¼Jesus|ðŸ‘¼Jesus]] protects us [^b1]. Satan does have other names that may be worth further study in the future but for this study we will not be focusing on that today.

[^cite1]: [Strong's Greek: 4567. Î£Î±Ï„Î±Î½á¾¶Ï‚ (Satanas) -- 36 Occurrences](https://biblehub.com/greek/strongs_4567.htm)
[^cite2]: [Strong's Greek: 1228. Î´Î¹Î¬Î²Î¿Î»Î¿Ï‚ (diabolos) -- slanderous, accusing falsely](https://biblehub.com/greek/1228.htm)
[^b1]: [[1 John 2|1 John 2:1]] - This passage talks about hos Jesus is our protector and advocate before God.
## Satan's Goal

Throughout scripture Satan is compared to a wolf, a destroy, a trickster all of these focus on that Satan's goal is to kill us [^b2].

[^b2]:  [[John 10|John 10:10]] - This passage is where Jesus describes Satan's target to steal, kill and destroy us.
  [[John 8|John 8:44]] - This passage is where Jesus describes Satan as a "murderer from the beginning"
## The Power of Satan
Before we being here it is important to remember that God is sovereign. This means that if Satan is going to do a thing he **must** ask for permission or that God has veto power over Satan at any time. For the sake of looking at Satan's power we will first look at Jesus' temptation specifically the second temptation when Satan offers Jesus all the kingdoms of the world, Satan does have the power to give you things and build you up for selfish desires. These will be used to achieve his Goals of destroying us [^b2a] [^related1]. We also must ackoledge though that Satan is a liar and thus his promises are empty and will result in you being destroyed [^b2b].

Satan by his nature has a increased power than us simply because he is an angel this is not human and is not as limited as we are. This also menas he is by virtue of have existed since the start of the world become much wiser than we even if he is not given wisdom or power from God (note that we can gain wisdom over him through God of course) This being said Satan though he has authority of  the earth he does not have authority over people unless they (or God) give it to him (and this is also not possible for Christians)

[^b2a]: [[Luke 4|Luke 4:6]] - This is the specific reference to Jesus being tempted and Satan offering him "all the kingdoms of the world"
  [[1 John 5|1 John 5:19]] - This passage talks on how all the world is under the power of the "evil one"
[^related1]: This reminds me of the [[Comparison of Icarus and Jesus]]
[^b2b]: [[John 8|John 8:44]] - This passage is where Satan is called the "father of lies".

### Satan's Effect on Christians

As a Christian we have the [[Holy Spirit]] which empowers us to see through Satan's lies and schemes thus Satan's normal power is somewhat thwarted. But any older Christian will tell you if you are living for God Satan will be opposing you. One of the best method to thwart and rest form the oppression is to Parise God (this is also why it is important to be in [[../Church|Church]])  [^b2c].

The second element to this is that if Satan cannot slow you down, as he name states he will accuse you and this is why we must be filled with wisdom to avoid even the chance to accuse you [^b2d].

[^b2c]: [[James 4|James 4:7]] - This passage talks about resisting the devil via humility and seeking God.
[^b2d]: [[Ephes 4|Ephes 4:27]] - This is specific to not giving the devil an opportunity to accuse yo via anger by letting it go quickly. Note that we will be discussing anger later in the study.

## Satan's End
We know from scripture that Satan has been doomed to the lake of fire from the begging [^b3].

[^b3]: [[Matt 25|Matthew 25:41]] - This passage has Jesus mentioned that the Lake of Fire was specific made for the Devil and demons
  [[Rev 20|Rev 20:10]] - This passage describes the Devil being sent into the lake of Fire.


## Our Fight
Now we let the rubber meat the road. We are going to be looking through how our testimony impacts how much effect Satan can have in our life.

Something important to acknowledge is a angle and if you remember angels are organized based on authority. Similarly we have authority **over Satan** through Jesus. This authority is based on present Jesus in your life and thus he will address you [^b4]. This is formulated when we have full commitment to Christ and become a living sacrifice for God living in a manner where we are living fully for Christ.

### The Full Truth

In reality we must also understand that **ALL POWER BELONGS TO CHRSIT**, this is the main point of this study and it is important you understand that all of this comes to Glorify Jesus as much as possible.

[^b4]: [[Matt 10|Matt 10:32]] - This passage has a statement from Jesus about if we acknowledge him before men then he will present us before God.
# Future
We are in the future going to talk more specifically on Strategies of Satan and practical counter attacks. Then we will be doing a intro to demonology. To end out this section of the study we will also talk about the overall defeat of Satan.

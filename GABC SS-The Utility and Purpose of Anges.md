# Review
- We are in a Spiritual War
- Our Enemy is Satan
- Satan desires to take Glory from God
- Satan uses a common series of Tactics too attack us
    - Bad Questions focusing on what [[God]] doesn't allow us to do
    - Twisting Truths in small incremental ways
    - Blatant Contradictions with the Truth
- We fight on various "Battle Fronts"
    - Individual
    - Family
    - Churth
    - Society
- There are two "structures" that Satan builds
    - Mental Fortresses - used to make us "POWs" in this Spiritual battle. Symptoms are basically a addiction or difficult sin that one cannot shake
        - Defeated via prayer, Study, meditation, fasting, service and obedience
    - Partitions - a "wall" within the mind to split you between "holy" and "unholy" or being double-minded
        - defeated via "Thought Claiming" or bringing your thoughts under submission and giving them to Christ
    - All attacks from Satan are countered via
        - Seeking God for Wisdom
        - Getting closer to God
        - Getting the correct view of Sin

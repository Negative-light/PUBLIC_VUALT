# Review
- We are in a Spiritual War
- Our Enemy is Satan
- Satan desires to take Glory from God
- Satan uses a common series of Tactics too attack us
    - Bad Questions focusing on what [[God]] doesn't allow us to do
    - Twisting Truths in small incremental ways
    - Blatant Contradictions with the Truth
- We fight on various "Battle Fronts"
    - Individual
    - Family
    - Churth
    - Society
- There are two "structures" that Satan builds
    - Mental Fortresses - used to make us "POWs" in this Spiritual battle. Symptoms are basically a addiction or difficult sin that one cannot shake
        - Defeated via prayer, Study, meditation, fasting, service and obedience
    - Partitions - a "wall" within the mind to split you between "holy" and "unholy" or being double-minded
        - defeated via "Thought Claiming" or bringing your thoughts under submission and giving them to Christ
    - All attacks from Satan are countered via
        - Seeking God for Wisdom
        - Getting closer to God
        - Getting the correct view of Sin

[^b3]: [[Matt 4|Matt 4:11]] - This is after [[../30-Spiritual/33-Resources/33.10-People/ðŸ‘¼Jesus|ðŸ‘¼Jesus]] was in the wilderness and had finished this trial did angels come and provide for him

### Spiritual "Ladders"
Next we will discus Spiritual Ladders, in the book Evans ties this into the call of Nathaniel, which is interesting. But the goal is too connect a few things these The Ladder is used to represent God's blessings on earth.

- Sometimes God's provision or healing is going to wait till **AFTER** you have completed a trial [^b3]

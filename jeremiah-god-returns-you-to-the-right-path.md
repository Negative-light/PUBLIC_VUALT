# Review
We are in a section of Jeremiah where [[God]] is explaining through [[p-jeremiah|Jeremiah]] how he will bring the [[p-nation-of-israel|Nation of Israel]] back to the promised land. This of course also reflects onto the return of Israel in the end times and how God will treat Christians in the end times.

The first part of Jeremiah 21 showed us that it is importnat to look back at the good things God has done and that God's redemptive power is not limited. This shows us both the practical thing to do when you are going through a hard time and how we should handle others that we might thing have "gone too far".

# Lesson
Our section today is a poem describing the people who will return to [[city-jerusalem|Jerusalem]] and the joy of the return [^1].

## Rejoice for God calls his people
This section starts with an explicit call to rejoice because God is going to gather people from the "northern land" (this is likely [[üèôÔ∏èBabylon|Babylon]] [^garner-howes] [^matthew-poole]) and remote spaces. Note that a set of "hurdles" are present. There are women about to go into labor and the people are weak. But "they will not stumble" [^1].

Something important of Israel being called foremost of nations. this is a signal that Israel is still the beloved of God, despite her having been an adulterous nation [^ellicott]. Now this same phrase could also be interpreted to publicly proclaim the joy "Infront of" the nations [^john-calvin]. This will carry over later but this joy or Israel would flow into all nations [^enduring-word], this of course I would say is a forecalling to [[jesus|Jesus]]. Another thing to see is that although God is calling the people to celebrate it requires that they proclaim that God saves the remnant of Israel [^1], this is that they are called express the promises of God [^matthew-henry]. 

Of course we can dive through that God is helping those who were coming as well. There are the blind and lamb who would need plenty of help. There are also near term expectant mothers traveling from Iraq to Israel which is ~900 miles over 4 months [^5]. 

During their coming back of course it will not be easy, it will be hard. But God is faithful and provides places to rest for the people. Toward smoother paths and will not be made weak. Now this weeping could be for the joy as well but it is likely a mix [^matthew-poole] and we see that when they return [^6].

Of course this section directly applies to Israel but it applies to us as well [^john-gill]. This is important for all this section as it is very much a "dually complete" prophecy.

## The Word of the Lord is Spread
When studying this section I found the next few verses I found interesting. The word of God is spread by Israel, mind they were called to do so even before Christ and ultimately after Christ we are called to share the word [^4]. The reasons here are even similar [^1].

At this point we know that we are now including the whole world. Mind that this would include those that Israel wouldn't have been able to connect with [^ellicott]. But the point here that although God had scattered Israel he would also guard them in that scattering to bring them back [^john-calvin]. 


## Great Joy
The final verses talk of the joy and celebration of people. That is that they would radiate joy, dancing, assumedly singing. Furthermore the priests  lived in abundance which (what does that mean). The fact is that God has brough in a great moment such that the people cannot help but celebrate [^1]. 

Now we see how the people "radiate joy", frankly I wish i know how that was possible, but have y'all met someone who isn't just one who cases. Furthermore their life being a well watered garden, or that their inner life will be thriving [^ellicott] calling back to those who love and serve God [^7]

Now it is important to note that this explicitly if fulfilled in Christ in some sense, because we are the ones who inherit that "fountain of living water". We see the full fufillment when Christ will wipe all of our pain away [^matthew-poole].

Something I find interesting is that the priests will be abundantly supplied for. That is that the people will have so much that all the priests will have plenty to live with [^enduring-word]. This also is a blessing for a church, we see that all of our pastors are not just "surviving" but they are able to go and do and rest and we are find. This ties into an idea of the church having healthy rest cycles and many laying back on the main pastor some but that is a whole separate convo.


# Applications

## God Returns You onto the Right Path
When praying and pondering this section this was the first idea that came to my own mind. Basically we see here how God brings Israel back to her initial calling. That is

1. Claim the promised land
2. Spread the word of the coming Messiah
3. Be God's blessing on the Word

For us as believers this is similar. no matter how off the main path you end up on, God can and will get you back if you look to him. If you repent of your sins. God is faithful to bring you back to the "main line" of your calling.

This can be done primary by acknowledging God [^2], who he is, and that he has made you. Both initially and the new creation that you are now. Once there, truthfully is there anything that can stop us [^3].

And like last week we can add that this doesn't have the standard limits we would apply. God is the primary driver of the change of action because of repentance, God is the primary driver for the events in your calling. Ultimately from God we can do all things, and for God we shall do all things.

## WE are all Thermostats
There was an analogy/call to action when we were younger of if you are going to be a thermometer or a thermostat. Basically the idea was are you going to influence the space you are in, or be controlled by it. I honestly think this is false. A thermostat is a thermometer that is connected to a temperature control system, basically just a glorified switch. We could get into detail of how we look like this but i think that verse 12 where we see the idea of the 'radiating joy' is important. 

The fact is that you influence the people around you, if you like it or not. And the fact is that if you aren't intentional about the influence you provide then it is likely to be the opposite of what you desire.

This was honestly a slap in the face for me, because i teach and lead in a direction that I tend to have an attitude that it is opposed to. I am certain there is plenty of scripture on how that is also **very** wrong. But honestly I need to be better and I think we should all remember that. 

Furthermore that is what leadership is. Leadership is influence over other people. And we don't get too choose that we have influence, only the direction of that influence. The strength of that influence comes from God and from our relationship with others. 

## Unity Across Ages
Something that has been on my mind a lot lately is the idea of age segregation and its damage to our culture. Mind this isn't an original idea, and I don't know that i fully agree as I think there are benefits, but we are definitely past the point of it being beneficial.

In verse 13 we see old and young rejoice together. the fact is that young and old have always been combating each other. But that combating allows for steady and healthy growth if done well. Meanwhile now the youth are tossed aside to their bubble. I think there is good reason to have youth separate from the church but better systems that involve all generations needs to be sought I think

# Last Week
Last week we focused on how [God](God.md) warns the nations of the coming judgment on [Israel](p-nation-of-israel.md). This comes from them rejecting of the "ancient paths" of wisdom from God. We also talked aobut how Israel was walking in "vain repetition". This culminates in God placing "stumbling blocks" in the path of Israel.

# This Week
[^m1]: [Jer 6:22-26](Jer%206.md)
[^m2]: [Jer 6:27-30](Jer%206.md)
[^b1]: [Josh 1:9](Josh%201.md)

## Israel is Called to Mourn
Our fist segment see [üèôÔ∏èBabylon](%F0%9F%8F%99%EF%B8%8FBabylon.md) being described as a evil unrelenting force (this for some reason only brings the Orcs of LoTR to mind) and Israel being described as week and begging for mercy that will not come. Then we see Israel being called to mourn [^m1]. Oddly the first thought I had is that Israel is told when interning the [üìåCanaan](%F0%9F%93%8CCanaan.md) that they should not be afraid because God is with them [^b1] but here we see Israel have dep and "palpable" fear [^john-gill]. But even at this point God reminds them that He would return if they repent by mourning [^guzik]. 

### Applications
- Have you felt deep mourning full sorrow over your sins?
- Do you remember actively that God is with you and has called us to do all things to His glory?

## Jeremiah's Calling
Ok now we switch pages just a bit and see Jeremiah being called as a "refiner" or judge over Israel and we see this call to refinement [^m2]. Jeremiah is becoming  the "blacksmith" if you will of Israel. One of my favorite events at the Georgia National Fair is "Purgatory Ironworks" which is a little blacksmithing show. Here they heat the metal up with a mobile replica of a military bellows. This show I feel is quite nice to enjoy. Something important from this show is that  a town could not succeed without a blacksmith. Blacksmiths are necessary for building, putting on horse shoes etc. The blacksmith made thousands of useful tools and equipment for all of the city ranging from pots and pans to even civil ware (such as the Iron Spoon that Purgatory Ironworks makes at their fair shows). Similarly this "blacksmith" of Israel I think is a necessary role. Although we see Jeremiah being called this we see this common theme throughout. The 1st century church had [üßëPaul](%F0%9F%A7%91Paul.md), we have the Judges throughout the book of [Judges](Judges/Judges.md). This being said like pastors are shepherds for a congregation this doesn't map to God. In reality these people are the "assistant" and God is making us into unique items that are useful. Weaker metals cannot be used for some things (would you like to live in a house with nothing but aluminum nails).

### Applications
- How can you help correct and/or buildup others around you?
- Are you willingly letting yourself be corrected or refined by God?

# Next Week

Please read all of Chapter 7. Why? I want you to find a application to your life in the next chapter. How is it useful what did you learn etc. WE may not hit the whole thing but yeah.

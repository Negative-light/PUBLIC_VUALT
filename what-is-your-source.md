[^b1]: [Deut 32:28-33](Deut%2032.md) - this passage contains statements from [ðŸ§‘Moses](%F0%9F%A7%91Moses.md) about how [God](God.md) is greater than the world
[^b2]: [John 15:5](John%2015.md) - this verse we see that the vine of Christians is [jesus](jesus.md)7:24-25](Matt%207.md) - this passage shows us that the words of Jesus (ie [The Bible](The%20Bible.md)) are a foundational rock for us to build upon
[^b4]: [1 Cor 3:9-14](1%20Cor%203.md) - here we see that we as Christians are the building of Christ. Furthermore we see that Jesus is a pure foundation that we should be attached to.
[^b5]: [James 15-6:](James%201.md) - here we see that God will give us wisdom in abundance in [Faith](Faith.md)
[^b6]: [Gal 6:22-23](Gal%206.md) - here we see what the [Fruit of the Spirit](Fruit%20of%20the%20Spirit.md) is
# God is Greater
Todays study is focused on how what God does is better than that of the world.

## The World
We see a sample of the world and its source/foundation in Moses' song, which is one of the last things he does. The world is decided as having no wisdom and have a weaker "rock" (Truthfully here Moses spends more time describing the power of God as he should), and producing poisonous/bitter fruit [^b1].

## Our God
So what does God do? What type of God do we have? A good one. Ok lets close up we done here.


That is of course sarcasm. We know so much about how God counters these things and the specifics of it.
### The Good Fruit
The first thing we should compare is the vine discussed here. Even from the time to Moses into today wine is a important thing... where does wine come from, grapes. Unlike the poisonous fruit of "the world" Jesus is the supply of our faith and the source of our good fruit [^b2]. This fruit is this life filling thing for others, with the end goal to share the [Gospel](../Gospel.md) [^b6].

### The Solid Rock
Through the bible we see God being described as our rock but I wanted to focus on how Jesus is our rock. We see that his words are a strong foundation that can weather a storm [^b3]. Furthermore we see that Christ is the irreplicable foundation of the Gospel [^b4].

### The Endless Well of Wisdom
Finally we see that we have endless wisdom through Jesus if we ask in faith. This directly counters the lack of Wisdom in the world [^b5].

# Conclusion/CTA
So what are you seeking to fill you. Are you seeking the poisons of our world (ie porn/money/fame)?
Are you trying to build your life on Christ? are you seeking what to build via the word?
Are you faithfully seeking God for wisdom? This one is important for our age group, as we are in the first phases of having the "gun" to shoot ourselves with (this being a metaphor that we could shoot ourselves in the foot).

# Review
We are in a Study on the Spiritual war for Glory between [[God]] and Satan.
As of late we have discussed the strongholds we find within ourselves and how we must submit to Christ and also *resist* Satan. 
Next we analyzed how Satan is attacking the family and how it is important to place Christ at the center of the faimly and encourage unity and following roles  defined in the Bible. 
As always it is important to remember our victory is *already* won in [[../30-Spiritual/33-Resources/33.10-People/jesus|👼Jesus]].

# Today
Today we look at strongholds that have formed within the [[Church]].

## Examples
- Racism
- Classism
- Spiritual Distancing/othering
- Concrete Cliques
- Open Unrepented Sins [^note1]

[^note1]: **Note**: This one is seen as early as the time of the apostles as this is the purpose of the book of [[30-Spiritual/BIBLE_CSB_MD/1 Corinthians/1 Corinthians|1 Corinthians]]

## How do we fix these things
Most of us know that our church has some serous problems. Not only locally with some current squables and/or extra-Biblical standings, etc.
The question is not *what is the problem* I don't think, most of us can see the problems. Most of us look at it and it hurts. You will never guess the Answer?

Should I pull a YouTuber here and not say the obvious for like 10 minutes?
No! It's [[../30-Spiritual/33-Resources/33.10-People/jesus|👼Jesus]] 

But it isn't just Jesus. Sure it is Jesus but it is about understanding the Christ that we follow. Most of us look at the Jesus of the Gospels. A meek carpenter turned wandering Rabbi teaching of the fulfillment of the Law through his death. Sure this is a *part* of the Christ we server, but we must understand what happens at the end of the Gospels and the start of the book of Acts. What happened then? 

> [!NOTE]
> Have the people answer. Jesus went to the Father to Rule.

Jesus is a conquering King. You may have noticed when we talked about the amor of God we talked about being co-conquerors. Guess who is the conqueror. There is a wonderful image of Jesus in Revelation where he is the epic Warrior King [^b1]. The question to ponder is do we as a church worship this Jesus? Do we see him as this powerful or have we lowered him to our level?

[^b1]: [[Rev 1|Rev 1:12-16]] - This passage we have Jesus has a mighty kinda of Great power.

## What is our Standard
Something important to consider is that We as a church have a standard we must meet. That is Jesus as a whole. His vision for the church. We have a Mission etc. The book even provides a great anaology of setting your clock to the "standard clock" in the US (and most of the world today) this is a set of atomic clocks positioned throughout the world that send out a signal and even today you can buy a "automatically calibrating" clock (though these are still somehow expensive despite the tech being simple).

### Our Target
recently I have been studying different analysis systems. One that came to mind during this is [[../MOST Analysis|MOST Analysis]] which is basically a "alignment" system. Withing this you Define your Mission and create objectives to reach that mission. With those you define strategies or methods to meet your objectives and create tactics or action items to execute those strategies. I think this is a practical way to do things. But there are other analysis systems such as [[../SWOT Analysis|SWOT Analysis]] (Strengths Weaknesses Opportunities and Threats) that also apply and help along the way. Ironically Jesus spells out the threat of letting a program supersede our passion for Jesus [^b2]. I would say this is a issue with many good doctrine churches. They have all the right answers, but the flame behind those has died out.

To put it in terms that at least I am familiar with, its like we have the correct hardware for everything but we do not have the software drivers, therefore the hardware is useless. This is true for churches, ironically I think this is where we also see these churches become unloving sometimes after an extended period like this. This is based on how one can have all the gifts of the Spirit but without love it is pointless [^b3]. Personally I would say it this way, that Love is the heat output from the *fire* produce by a church from Jesus. 

[^b2]: [[Rev 2|Rev 2:2-4]] This passage is a call out from Jesus to the church in [[🏙️Ephesus]].
[^b3]: [[1 Cor 13|1 Cor 13:1-3]] - this passage talks about how we can preach well, have all the right answers and gifts of the Spirit but without love we are pointless.

#### What happens when it goes wrong?

So when we loose our passion or love for Jesus as a church (mind I think of this as more of a dimming rather than the fire being put out) Satan can gain ground and plant a stronghold or idea that is against the will of God that we think is unchangeable.

An example form my church is that we will inevitably die soon because we have not young people. Now this may be valid but God is highlighting that he isn't really done with this church, and I think some of what it is is that we collectibly have kinda lost sight a little. We may have dimmed slightly and what Jesus is calling us to *especially the young people* is to put on Fire for Jesus Christ to be revived.

### Growing Weakness
Faithfulness is another message specific to the church in [[🏙️Smyrna]]. They basically are not standing for Christ the moment persecution comes up. Think of them like the rocky soil from the [[Parable of the Sower]]. [^b4] but the truth behind this is that we all sometimes don't seek Jesus when the going gets tough. This applies not only to persecution but also to trials. When there is financial stress, etc we as a church are not faithful (and keeping each other accountable) to seek Jesus. For me it even can apply to the stress of seeking God and your calling.

[^b4]: [[Rev 2|Rev 2:9-10]] - This passage is the message of Jesus to the church in [[🏙️Smyrna]] and how they do not stand up for persecution.

### Biblical Compromise
One of the biggest issue of the American church is that we have compromised our morals for the sake of "tolerance" for things like the LGBT movement.
This isn't new other churches were dealing with this and attempted to merge local religions with Christianity. [^b5] 
This is why it is **fundamentally important** that we seek correct doctrine in the church and make it clear when someone is teaching outside of the biblical scope. 
Personally I believe this is also why we have such a high rate of moral failings in the church within America.

[^b5]: [[Rev 2|Rev 2:13-15]] - This is Jesus' message to [[🏙️Pergamum]] who were allowing false doctrines to infiltrate the church

### Unrepentant Sin
The other thing that can hold a church back is allowing for "large" public unrepentant sin. 
Examples today might include living a homosexual lifestyle, cheating, theft etc. 
This ironically seems to coincide with Biblical Compromise and Jesus once again calls churches to repent from that [^b6].
An important consideration in Jesus' callout is that this woman was allowed to publicly preach/teach both her heresy's and immorality .
This goes hand in hand with obedience which other churches were later commended for this. Ironically this is what also creates success in a weak church [^b6a]

[^b6]: [[Rev 2|Rev 2:19-20]] - this passage is on Jesus calling out the church of [[🏙️Thyatira]]  on not living a holy lifestyle and allowing outright wickedness in the church
[^b6a]: [[Rev 3|Rev 3:8-10]]] - this is a passage where Jesus commends the church at [[🏙️Philadelphia]] for being obedient.

### Getting Stuck in the Past
This one is one that is hard, I have been here. My church is/was here and it is hard to get out of sometimes churches try to stop and focus on the past successes they had. 
Back when the pews were full and not a Sunday went by without Baptism. 
This is where Jesus ironically makes a threat to "take" a church as well. [^b7]

[^b7]: [[Rev 3|Rev 3:1-3]] - This is the callout to the church in [[🏙️Sardis]] who had fallen asleep

### Focus on our own success
The final point is that sometimes we become prideful and see ourselves as the successful people. This was the case for the most famous of the churches called out in Revelation. The people were wealthy and ultimatly focused on their sucess. [^b8] A good test from the book is when your focus is on the blessings of God rather than his presence and power. This is one of the common items for Mega churches and it is hard to see soemtimes

[^b8]: [[Rev 3|Rev 3:15-17]] - the church of [[🏙️Laodicea]] being called out for their weath and not relying on God
# Next Week
We are going to hit on how we can mark our society for hte better.

# Other
This is just a collection of things for later.

> ... if we're not careful, we can reduce God to our size and fit Him to our convenience. When that happens the church is held hostage to a secular way of thinking.

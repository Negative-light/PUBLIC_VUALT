# Review
We are in a Study on the Spiritual war for Glory between [[God]] and Satan.
As of late we have discussed the strongholds we find within ourselves and how we must submit to Christ and also *resist* Satan. 
Next we analyzed how Satan is attacking the family and how it is important to place Christ at the center of the faimly and encourage unity and following roles  defined in the Bible. 
As always it is important to remember our victory is *already* won in [[30-Spiritual/33-Resources/33.10-People/游높Jesus|游높Jesus]].

# Today
Today we look at strongholds that have formed within the [[Church]].

## Examples
- Racism
- Classism
- Spiritual Distancing/othering
- Concrete Cliques
- Open Unrepented Sins [^note1]

[^note1]: **Note**: This one is seen as early as the time of the apostles as this is the purpose of the book of [[30-Spiritual/BIBLE_CSB_MD/1 Corinthians/1 Corinthians|1 Corinthians]]

## How do we fix these things
Most of us know that our church has some serous problems. Not only locally with some current squables and/or extra-Biblical standings, etc.
The question is not *what is the problem* I don't think, most of us can see the problems. Most of us look at it and it hurts. You will never guess the Answer?

Should I pull a YouTuber here and not say the obvious for like 10 minutes?
No! It's [[30-Spiritual/33-Resources/33.10-People/游높Jesus|游높Jesus]] 

But it isn't just Jesus. Sure it is Jesus but it is about understanding the Christ that we follow. Most of us look at the Jesus of the Gospels. A meek carpenter turned wandering Rabbi teaching of the fulfillment of the Law through his death. Sure this is a *part* of the Christ we server, but we must understand what happens at the end of the Gospels and the start of the book of Acts. What happened then? 

> [!NOTE]
> Have the people answer. Jesus went to the Father to Rule.

Jesus is a conquering King. You may have noticed when we talked about the amor of God we talked about being co-conquerors. Guess who is the conqueror. There is a wonderful image of Jesus in Revelation where he is the epic Warrior King [^b1]. The question to ponder is do we as a church worship this Jesus? Do we see him as this powerful or have we lowered him to our level?

[^b1]: [[Rev 1|Rev 1:12-16]] - This passage we have Jesus has a mighty kinda of Great power.

## What is our Standard
Something important to consider is that We as a church have a standard we must meet. That is Jesus as a whole. His vision for the church. We have a Mission etc. The book even provides a great anaology of setting your clock to the "standard clock" in the US (and most of the world today) this is a set of atomic clocks positioned throughout the world that send out a signal and even today you can buy a "automatically calibrating" clock (though these are still somehow expensive despite the tech being simple).

### Our Target
recently I have been studying different analysis systems. One that came to mind during this is [[../MOST Analysis|MOST Analysis]] which is basically a "alignment" system. Withing this you Define your Mission and create objectives to reach that mission. With those you define strategies or methods to meet your objectives and create tactics or action items to execute those strategies. I think this is a practical way to do things. But there are other analysis systems such as [[../SWOT Analysis|SWOT Analysis]] (Strengths Weaknesses Opportunities and Threats) that also apply and help along the way. Ironically Jesus spells out the threat of letting a program supersede our passion for Jesus [^b2]. I would say this is a issue with many good doctrine churches. They have all the right answers, but the flame behind those has died out.

To put it in terms that at least I am familiar with, its like we have the correct hardware for everything but we do not have the software drivers, therefore the hardware is useless. This is true for churches, ironically I think this is where we also see these churches become unloving sometimes after an extended period like this. This is based on how one can have all the gifts of the Spirit but without love it is pointless [^b3]. Personally I would say it this way, that Love is the heat output from the *fire* produce by a church from Jesus. 

[^b2]: [[Rev 2|Rev 2:2-4]] This passage is a call out from Jesus to the church in [[游끷勇뀬phesus]].
[^b3]: [[1 Cor 13|1 Cor 13:1-3]] - this passage talks about how we can preach well, have all the right answers and gifts of the Spirit but without love we are pointless.

# Review
Ok this week we will be closing out a study on Spiritual Warfare we understand a lot more now. 
We understand that this battle is between [God](God) and Satan. We understand that Satan is really just trying to claim up the glory of God. 
We understand that a major part of Spiritual Warfare is authority and that all authority comes from God.

In the last few weeks we have study the armor of God and the power of prayer and that we need to put on [ðŸ‘¼Jesus](../30-Spiritual/33-Resources/33.10-People/ðŸ‘¼Jesus.md) every day. 
Further we discussed how to defeat strongholds in your personal life via thought claiming and accountability.
Strongholds in the family can similarly be defeated by proper submission to the right authority and  [love](../30-Spiritual/33-Resources/33.20-Words/33.21-English/love.md).
Last week we looked into the strongholds that form in the church and the examples of the [7 Churches of Revelation](7_Churches_of_Revelation).

# Today
WE now hit the large scale and see how we can go beyond defeating strongholds in the church and how we can lead others.
The first thing we must acknowledge is the structure of reality from the spiritual perspective.
The bible highlights four "levels" of leadership in the spiritual and physical world and we have discussed them several times but lets actually define them [^b1] [^note1].

## Definition of Leadership concepts in the Bible
### Authorities
Authorities are the culture that legitimize the ruling system of the day.
This includes governing documents, culture, traditions and religious systems.

### Rulers
Rulers are specific people in leadership.
This includes any level of leadership ranging from a county sherif to the President of the United States.
This are the people that sit on a *throne*.

### Dominion
A dominion is the "zone of control" of a rule.
Dominions have their own specific authorities and have a *throne*.
Dominions though specifically defined as a physical space (such as the 50 states of the US) may also contain "metaphysical" areas such as a social media platform etc.

### Throne
A throne is the seat of authority.
Thrones may have "sub thrones"


[^b1]: [Col 1:16](Col%201) - this verse is one of the that talks about the four structures or levels of leadership
  [Ephes 1:21](Ephes%201) - This verse also mentions similar structures
[^note1]: **Note** - as far as I am aware these are unique definitions that are not directly defined in scripture. But if one finds better definitions please create  a Issue on the Github.
  I personally am not fully agreeing with these and I defently need to *build* a better system.

# Review
Ok this week we will be closing out a study on Spiritual Warfare we understand a lot more now. 
We understand that this battle is between [God](God) and Satan. We understand that Satan is really just trying to claim up the glory of God. 
We understand that a major part of Spiritual Warfare is authority and that all authority comes from God.

In the last few weeks we have study the armor of God and the power of prayer and that we need to put on [ðŸ‘¼Jesus](../30-Spiritual/33-Resources/33.10-People/ðŸ‘¼Jesus.md) every day. 
Further we discussed how to defeat strongholds in your personal life via thought claiming and accountability.
Strongholds in the family can similarly be defeated by proper submission to the right authority and  [love](../30-Spiritual/33-Resources/33.20-Words/33.21-English/love.md).
Last week we looked into the strongholds that form in the church and the examples of the [7 Churches of Revelation](7_Churches_of_Revelation).

# Today
WE now hit the large scale and see how we can go beyond defeating strongholds in the church and how we can lead others.
The first thing we must acknowledge is the structure of reality from the spiritual perspective.
The bible highlights four "levels" of leadership in the spiritual and physical world and we have discussed them several times but lets actually define them [^b1] [^note1].



[^b1]: [Col 1:16](Col%201) - this verse is one of the that talks about the four structures or levels of leadership
  [Ephes 1:21](Ephes%201) - This verse also mentions similar structures
[^note1]: **Note** - as far as I am aware these are unique definitions that are not directly defined in scripture. But if one finds better definitions please create  a Issue on the Github.
  I personally am not fully agreeing with these and I defently need to *build* a better system.

## Definition of Leadership concepts in the Bible
### Authorities
Authorities are the culture that legitimize the ruling system of the day.
This includes governing documents, culture, traditions and religious systems.

### Rulers
Rulers are specific people in leadership.
This includes any level of leadership ranging from a county sherif to the President of the United States.
This are the people that sit on a *throne*.

### Dominion
A dominion is the "zone of control" of a rule.
Dominions have their own specific authorities and have a *throne*. 
Dominions though specifically defined as a physical space (such as the 50 states of the US) may also contain "metaphysical" areas such as a social media platform etc.

### Throne
A throne is the seat of authority.
Thrones may have "sub thrones" where they have leant a portion of their dominion out to.
In America this could be considered a "Office" rather than a Throne, because the authority of the President (or any political leader) comes from the "Office of the President". [^note2]

[^note2]: **Note** - this is a good kicking off point of how did thrones become officees. I mean essentially they are the same concept but still.
## Why Talk about this?
There is a important perspective the book has on this I think is important to have. 
Mind that God is still in control, I don't think we need to hear that again. 
I think that this quote is useful as we continue with this lesson.

> ...what I  want us to see is that institutional, structural evil is not just accidental or random.
\- Tony Evans, *The Battle is the Lords* pg 344

See Satan is going to control a society through all levels of its structure. Institutional sin or corruption is **extremely** hard to solve.


> [!NOTE]
> Maybe bring up the problem of poverty and how poverty cycles are really really hard to solve and although there are ways to solve it the biggest issue is institutional corruption

## What are we to do?
The goal of the church should be to attack the institutional *corruption* within. A few thoughts here is that truth is the best disinfectant. An example of how the church can do this is [ðŸ§‘Moses](ðŸ§‘Moses) helping call the [Nation of Israel](Nation%20of%20Israel) out of [ðŸ“ŒEgypt](ðŸ“ŒEgypt).

### Where did we go wrong?
We have a long history of revival/awakening in America but it has honestly been a long time. If you count the "Jesus Freak" revival the last one we had was in 1960 [^cite1]. Within this time the church has become well stagnant and acting in a "we are powerless" mentality. 
Where does this mentality come from? The book suggests it is the idea that we cannot distinguish between God and Satan and thus we try to give thank *for* everything, which counters our calling to give thanks *in* everything [^b3].

[^cite1]: [9 Things You Should Know About Revivals in America](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/article/9-things-revivals-america/)
[^b3] [[1 Thess 5|1 Thess 5:16-18]] - this is our call to give thanks and re experence joy in all life circumstances.

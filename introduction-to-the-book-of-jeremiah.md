# Review
**No Review this is a new lesson plan**

# Today
We have decided to go through the book of [[../30-Spiritual/BIBLE_CSB_MD/Jeremiah/Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] for the remainder of this year. I personally have the goal of finishing the book by the end of the year, but we will see how it goes and it may just take longer.

## Introduction
So what is the book of Jeremiah about. Well it is the story of the prophet [[../p-jeremiah|Jeremiah]] who works in the area around [[../city-jerusalem|Jerusalem]]. He specifically prophesied about the [[Southern Kingdom|Kingdom of Judah]] being taken over by [🏙️Babylon](%F0%9F%8F%99%EF%B8%8FBabylon.md) if the people didn't turn from idolatry. [^cite1]


This book is a collection of Jeremiah's sermons, poems and essays rather than just a simple book of prophecy. Thus it will appear to be a assortment of writings... that is because that is what it is. [^cite1]


[^cite1]: [Book of Jeremiah: Guide with Key Information and Resources](https://bibleproject.com/guides/book-of-jeremiah/)


### Sections

#### A Call to Repent
The first 24 chapters consist of Jeremiah calling the people to return the the covenant and flee from Idolatry. A central theme is the comparison of adultery & idolatry[^note1].  It even highlights how the political and social corruption is harming the vulnerable in the Nation. [^cite1]



#### A Future of Pain and Fortune
From chapters 25 to chapter 46 Jeremiah is focused on the coming punishment of Babylon conquering the people and them going into exile *because* they wouldn't repent. During this section Jeremiah is focused on expounding on words of [🧑Moses](%F0%9F%A7%91Moses.md) and how [God](God.md) will write a new work on their hearts through the [[../30-Spiritual/33-Resources/33.10-People/jesus|Messiah]] [^cite1].

#### God the Avenger
The final section of the book is on how God uses Babylon to judge a variety of nations not just Israel but spends a significant amount of time on how God will also judge Babylon comparing the lofty nation to the [Tower of Babel](Tower%20of%20Babel.md).

The final chapters the capture of Jerusalem and is a excerpt from [2 Kings 25](2%20Kings%2025.md).

## The call of Jeremiah
Now we are going to get stated with the book. Where we see essentially a set of Kings that Jeremiah served under. Giving you the general timeline of his service. [^b1]

[^b1]: [Jer 1:1-3](Jer%201.md) - this passage is just the book of Jeremiah being introduced and seems to be pompously written.

Then we enter Jeremiah's initial vision which parallels other visions from prophets [^note2]. Here we see something important verse on the topic of abortion. God knew Jeremiah before his birth and at the point he had giving this man his calling. [^b2]

[^b2]: [Jer 1:4-5](Jer%201.md) - this is the opening of the call of Jeremiah where we see  that Jeremiah received a calling in his mothers womb

From here we see the ever so common example of someone balking at their calling, truthfully this would be a good study in and of itself, but today we focus here. Jeremiah believed that due to his age and subsequent lack of experience that he could not speak well enough that the people would listen this is more of a fear response and God counters this fear with the concept that He is in Jeremiah's corner fighting for him. [^b3]
For our group this is important and the Bible has more to say. We as Christians are called to be examples in all of our life. [^b4] Or that we should not live in a FOMO based or self conscious manner and enjoy our youthfulness while we have it using it to serve and know God. [^b5] 

[^b3]: [Jer 1:6-8](Jer%201.md) - here we see Jeremiah making the excuse of his age and how he wants to go on this.

[^b4]: [1 Tim 4:12](1%20Tim%204.md) - This verse is a excerpt from a encouraging message from [🧑Paul](%F0%9F%A7%91Paul.md) to [🧑Timothy](%F0%9F%A7%91Timothy.md) about him pushing forward despite being a very young pastor.

[^b5]: [Eccles 11:9-10](Eccles%2011.md) - this is from a secotion on how old age and youth are vanity and particularly oh youthfulness and how to use it well.

But God didn't stop there God gave this man inspiration, filling Jeremiah's mouth the words of God so that he might speak them and gave him a mission to seek after. To speak on destruction and rebuilding. This will be the angle we focus on this book fyi. [^b6]

I think it is exceedingly important that young Christians live with a mission or goal in life. For some of us this might be becoming a leading missionary to other nations, or it could very well be becoming a teach, engineer etc. Why is this the case? a Mission gives you direction and that Mission *should* always be from God and for God note that this may not always be obvious externally but the question is who do you answer to.

[^b6]: [Jer 1:9-10](Jer%201.md) - this is the end of God's call to Jeremiah where God gives him a mission statement.

[^note2]: **Note** - The one that particularly comes to mind is the call of [🧑Isaiah](%F0%9F%A7%91Isaiah.md) in [[../30-Spiritual/BIBLE_CSB_MD/Isaiah/Isa 1|Isa 1]]

# Next Week
We are going to hop into the prophecies of Jeremiah.


[^note1]: This reminds me of the idea of [The Church is the Bride of Christ](The%20Church%20is%20the%20Bride%20of%20Christ.md)

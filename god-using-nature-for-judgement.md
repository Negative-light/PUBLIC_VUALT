# Last Week

Last week we looked at some object lessons that [God](God.md) had [ðŸ§‘Jeremiah](%F0%9F%A7%91Jeremiah.md) showing how [Israel](../%F0%9F%8F%99%EF%B8%8F%F0%9F%8F%99%EF%B8%8FNation%20of%20Israel.md) has lsot the closeness of her relationship with God. This leads into describing how unchanged Israel would be. This taught us that we should allow God ot change us by renewing our mind.

## Side Note
A thought I had from a sermon on Exodus 14 is that Rebellion requres surender to something. This term comes form the word used for how Israel pressed against the Pharoh while fleeing. That rebellion requires that they surender to God.

For us we can either rebell against God or the world and rebellion against one requres surender to the other.

# This Week
[^m1]: [Jer 14:1-6](Jer%2014.md)
[^m2]: [Jer 14:7-10](Jer%2014.md)

This week we are focusing on a prophecy/lament on a drought that God will be sending to Israel. Some of this is because next week we are hitting a fun topic and the other side is I want to slow it down some as I think i am going *way* to far and not extracting everything we can... should I go on a rant about Pour Over yet.

## Setting The Scene
The start here we see God spell out a terrible drought [^m1]. This punishment is so bad that even the leadership of the nation is ending servants (probably long distances) to get water. This is obviously terrible for a agrarian nation. Note that this isn't a prophecy either [^enduring-word].

Something to see here. Water and life are tied together. we may not always think of it this way because we live in abundance heck if a BC Israelite came to the modern day they might consider it shameful how much we "waste" water. This drought was not considered just physically  it was a lack of life. A lack of the necessities (you will die in ~3 days with no fluids)

A key application too is that not only did this effect the people but the world around them [^enduring-word].

### Applications
1. As Americans how has *our* sin created negative effects on the environments around us?
2. As Christians we are called to run the race toward Christ. Although there is a case to be made that there are natural times where God will place us in a drought (consider Elijah), there are obviously times we are in a drought

## Remember the God of your Youth
This next section feels like a prayer from Jeremiah calling out to God to remember Israel to have mercy and show *His* will [^m2]. The proeblme is that the peoples repentance wouldn't be genuine and that is neccesary for God to revoke the judgment [^matthew-henry]. I think the question ask is also good to ask not only for a nation as a whole but for ones self
The name Hope of Israel is also used to show the presnece of God as the protector of the nation, the hero if you will [^ellicott]. The proble mof course being in the following bit, 
### Applications
Something important t apply is the first part of the prayer. Rather than just acknowledge their sin they ask God to act for the sake of his name. Do you have the faith to ask God to act for the will of the Kingdom? Do you understand that this could mean you loose everything, or not. This is a surrender of control

Is God like a "resident alien" or an outside in your life?

Finally the last part of verse nine. We bare the name of God. We are Christians we follow Christ. WE as a people are to bear God's name. He is among us but is he more like a "warrior  unable to save" not just in the nation but here at this church.

## Final Considerations
I want to go back to the rebellion. The last bit here Israel says they are rebelling against God. This means they have surrendered to God's oposite, Sin. Unlike God who wants the best for you and desires to treat you as a child to be nurtured. Sin is just an abusive master that ties you down, spiritually, mentally and finally physically.

You can only serve one master. Who are you choosing.


# Next Week
We are gonna be looking into the false teachers of the day.

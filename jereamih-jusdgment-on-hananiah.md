# Last Week
Last week we evaluated the object lesson [[God]] had [[p-jeremiah|Jeremiah]] present in the [[First Temple]]. This was wearing a yoke and informing people to go ahead and submit to the judgment to come as [[🏙️Babylon|Babylon]] was about to claim the last part of the [[Southern Kingdom]]. 

# This Week
This chapter we are introduced to a new character [[🧑Hananiah|Hananiah]] who is a false prophet during the time of [[🧑Zedekiah|Zedekiah]]. He outright denies the prophecies of Jeremiah and is thereby judged.

## Introduction
As we start the chapter we see Hananiah who is preaching the message that everything under Babylon would be returned in two years and that [[🧑Jehoiachin|Jehoiachin]] would return to ruling the nation [^1]. Now when diving into this prophecy we need to understand that this was also a national thing so his prophecy was about the nation and it is posited by Matthew Poole that Hananiah was mentioning specifically Jehoiachin for the same reason false teacher make any political lean clear, adjacency to power. [^matthew-poole].

The mention of  [[🏙️Gibeon|Gibeon]] a priest city that had also been known for a deceptive habit [^enduring-word] was also interesting and multiple commentaries to mention that tie. THis isn't a direct link from scripture but it is probably important sinze it was mentioned where Hananiah is from.

## Confrontation
Jeremiah having seen this tries to approaches Hananiah. Jeremih inital does agree and hope that two years would be the truth, but calls on all the previous prophets who also preach judgment and notes that a prophet is tested via the accuracy of his prediction. In response Hananiah breaks the yoke of Jeremiah *and* provides a prophecy that this is how God will break the yoke of Babylon [^2].

Now before I say  what I am about to understand that we should not agree with false teachings. BUT we should also have a heart like Jeremiah, who wanted the best for his people but understood that this false teaching would prevent them from repenting. We should pray that judgment doesn't destroy someone, understanding that sadly sometimes that will happen [^matthew-henry] The thing here is that Hananiah was confronting Jeremiah (one commentary mentioned this might be old bad blood [^ellicott]) but Jeremiah didn't get defensive understanding that God was his defense [^garner-howes].

Now of course we should understand that false prophets are going to be bold [^john-calvin]. Often because pretending boldness I think gives them the felling it is God's will.


The second repose I want to highlight. After the yoke was broken Jeremiah just walk away. Now this could have multiple reasons but the main one is that he didn't have something from God to say, now this meant he was "insulted" but he dealt with it [^john-gill]. We are going to deal with this problem as well.

> It may sometimes be our wisdom to retreat rather than contend
\- Matthew Henry [^matthew-henry]

## Judgment
After this Jeremiah provides a prophecy against Hananiah. Stating that Israel would be under an Iron Yoke and that this would be hard to break. And Hananiah would be "yeeted off the earth". This results in him dying about two months later [^3].

Now I don't think I need to point the symbolism with the yoke swap. Iron yoke will be worse. Now of course did this change the judgment of God, I don't think so. But I do think that if the people focused on Hananiah and the confrontation didn't happen then they wouldn't teach the things of God and the nation would repent during the exile period.

> If we resist God's gentler discipline - yokes of wood - we may find ourselves under much more unpleasant yokes of iron. Far better to surrender to the yoke of people/biblical/jesus|Jesus
\- David Guzik [^enduring-word]

We also see how Hananiah did heap judgment on himself. God caused his death in two months and I have to question if it wasn't some horrid health condition too. Now of course this also functioned as vindication for Jeremiah as well [^john-gill]. Deception is something that God doesn't treat lightly as it leads to corruption and corruption leads to destruction. WE have to see other warnings such as Ananias and Sapphira [^4].

## Applications

### Confronting Comforting False Teachings

1. Balance of Truth and Love of man and God.
    1. Example: [[Prosperity Gospel]]. God wants us to thrive, but that doesn't mean suffering isn't possible. God desires for us to have peace and joy in all situations
    2. Do not get focused on being proven right. Care more for the people God has sent us to minister too [^john-calvin].
2. This leads into how we confront others in general. Speak softly, in love. Be generous and allow people to repent.


### Self-Control In Responding to False Teachers
This is a problem i see far too often online. See how Jeremiah didn't instantly attack Hananiah. He stopped went away and came back later. I would assume to A) Fix any wounds, B) to let his anger rest and come back when God told him to speak

### Compromising Truth Yields Greater Punishment
As we look at the word and we apply it to our lives sometimes it is tempting to lower God's standard to a comfortable level. And this will bring judgment on us and even to those around us.



# Next Week
I believe we will actually do all of chapter 29 as well.

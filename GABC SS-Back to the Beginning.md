# Review
In the study we have already covered the following:
- We are in a Spiritual War
- Our Primary enemy is Satan
- The Battle is over Glory
- We covered the two types of Worldviews
    - Naturalistic - a worldview that believes there is only the physical world
    - Spiritual - a worldview that believes there is a spiritual world
        - **NOTE**: the level at which a spiritual worldview levels the importance of the spiritual world.


# Today
Today we are going to focus on the start of  the Spiritual war that started.

## A short history of Lucifer

### Satan's Position

Satan was at one point an angle and fell from heaven this is accounted for in [[30-Spiritual/BIBLE_CSB_MD/Ezekiel/Ezek 28|Ezek 28]]. 
**NOTE**: That this chapter appears too discus a human king of [[ðŸ“ŒTyre]], but starts too discus the nature or exalted position of Satan starting in verse 12.

Based on this passage it is believed that Satan was the "worship pastor" of heaven, literally leading the chior of angles that were called to bring glroy too God continuously
### Satan's Fall

[[30-Spiritual/BIBLE_CSB_MD/Isaiah/Isa 14#12|Isa 14:12-15]] describes a angle who came before and desired too position himself *above* [[God]] this is the passage known as the fall of Satan. In Satans fall he also convinced ~1/3 of all the angles [[30-Spiritual/BIBLE_CSB_MD/Revelation/Rev 12#14|Rev 12:14]].

Satan basicly wanted too take God's throne and take his position at the command center of the Kingdom. This is what the "Assembly in the Recesses of the North" discuses [[30-Spiritual/BIBLE_CSB_MD/Psalms/Ps 48#2|Ps 48:2]], [[30-Spiritual/BIBLE_CSB_MD/Isaiah/Isa 2#2|Isa 2:2]]. And the going above the clouds that reprent the **Glory** of God. [[30-Spiritual/BIBLE_CSB_MD/Exodus/Exod 16#10|Exod 16:10]], [[30-Spiritual/BIBLE_CSB_MD/Exodus/Exod 40#34|Exod 40:34]].

### Satan's Punishment

Immediately upon his rebellion Satan lost his position and was cast down too earth. [[30-Spiritual/BIBLE_CSB_MD/Revelation/Rev 12#12|Rev 12:12]]. This being said eternally Satan will be ast into the lake of fire and brimstone, [[30-Spiritual/BIBLE_CSB_MD/Revelation/Rev 20#10|Rev 20:10]].

## Why is this Important

Obviously this is where Spiritual Warfare really began, but it gives us some insights as it is hinted.
See it is believed that timeline wise this happened all the way back in the beging and could explain why the world was "formless and void" in [[../30-Spiritual/BIBLE_CSB_MD/Genesis/Gen 1|Gen 1]]. 

Ultamly we are here to bring God glory, there very thing Satan wanted too steal

### God's Relationship to us
God does want us too serve him, but not out of fear, he wants us too love him. As he demonstrated his love toward us, [[../30-Spiritual/BIBLE_CSB_MD/Romans/Rom 5#8|Rom 5:8]].

We should be trying too guard and protect God's Glory, that is the basis of what the Christian Life, is made of. Consider King Herod Agrippa who tried too take God's glory in [[../30-Spiritual/BIBLE_CSB_MD/Acts/Acts 12#20|Acts 12:20-23]].

This is accomplished via humbling ourselves before God and acknowledging our position before him, [[../30-Spiritual/BIBLE_CSB_MD/James/James 4#10|James 4:10]] and [[../30-Spiritual/BIBLE_CSB_MD/1 Peter/1 Pet 5#6|1 Pet 5:6]]. This is what fights the premodial sin of Pride.

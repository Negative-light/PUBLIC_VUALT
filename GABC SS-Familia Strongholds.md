# Review
We have been studying the Spiritual War between [[God]] and Satan. We understand that Satan's goal is to disable Christians such that we cannot bring glory to God.
We have more recently been studying how we fight in the war, including concepts like getting authority and placing the [[Armor of God]]. Furthermore we studied individual strongholds last week.

We also discussed last week Phycology and the church and how they relate. After a discussion with my brother something to consider is that a proper phycologist is not going to bring in religion. One item that is useful from a Christian phycologist is that they will have a better understanding of what you believe and be able to highlight things and use the Bible on occasion, but almost all cases that is true regardless of a phycologists religion. Thus I would advise *avoiding* any phycologist that advertises themselves as a Christian phycologist. Not because they are bad but because they are similar to a naturopath. A good one is great but a bad one could get you killed.
# Today
Today we are going to go further and try to combat familial strongholds. These includes things like divorce, abuse and how we can break them.


> [!NOTE]
> This lesson is going to be specific to the United States

## Satan's Attack on the Family
It is not surprise that Satan is attacking family today. This goes from negating the need for marriage in most people's eye such that between 2000 and 2022  the marriage rate per 1000 people has gone down from 8.2 to 6.2 [^source1]. Note that there are some things to consider here both spiritually and politically. But we will target these things later.

[^source1]: [cdc.gov/national-marriage-divorce-rates-00-22.pdf](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/dvs/marriage-divorce/national-marriage-divorce-rates-00-22.pdf)

### Degradation of Marriage
With-in my lifetime the concept of what marriage is, why you get married, when/if you get divorced have all been degredated within the US. So lets start with the Biblical definition of marriage.

Marriage is the union of one man, and one woman for life for the purpose of helping each other bring glory to God in their conjoined calling in both practical ministry and child rearing. [^b1]

#### Biblical Familial Rolls
Furthermore within a family there are three rolls.

The Man/Husband
1. Love his wife as Christ loves the Church and love her as much as he loves himself [^b2]
2. To lead the family in all areas [^b3]

The Woman/Wife
1. Submit to her husband [^b3] **NOTE**: that biblical submission here is a topic we may not get too deep on

The children
1. Obey Your Parents
2. Leave and Cleave [^b1]

Satan's first attack on marriage was to reverse these roles. This can show both in the husband and wife even today. [^b4]
1. Satan Made Adam passive sitting on the sidelines
2. Satan made Eve take over leadership

If you are not in the role that God has called you to Satan has a method to attack. This is especially true in marriage and the church (we will hit on that later). Ironically when we go back to the curses brought on by sin it even grantees strife within marriage. No longer is man and wife completing each other and trying to swap roles. Including the man becoming passive or not leading lovingly and the wife striving to become the leader of the family.

[^b1]: [[Gen 2|Gen 2:24-25]] - this is the definition of marriage based on the scriptures and the first marriage between [[ðŸ§‘Adam]] and [[ðŸ§‘Eve]].
[^b2]: [[Ephes 5|Ephes 5:21-33]] - this is where we get a biblical definition of the man and woman's roll in marriage
[b3]: [[1 Cor 11|1 Cor 11:3-10]] - this verse highlights in the middle of a discussion of head coverings the role of a husband
[^b4]: [[Gen 3]] - this passage is the fall of man and the resulting consequences

### The Infections within Modern Families

Satan has most decently infected the family, even the first family had massive issues (see [[ðŸ§‘Cain]] and [[ðŸ§‘Abel]]). For example Satan will use long lived anger to infect the family  planting seeds of hatred. These sometimes can start as a slight back when children are young, some of this could be on the parents as they should teach children (when they are young) to deal with anger and seek forgiveness and deal with problems ASAP as biblically recommended [^b5]. This anger can take many forms including future abuse, lashing out in sin, no contact, etc. All of these would be easier to solve if we handled our anger sooner rather than later. Note as well that the anger between parents  **will** effect the children and will the longer it lasts. Even if you think it was 100% private... yeah no it isn't the kids will be effected. How do we deal with anger well we forgive and this is like rejecting it. Unresolved anger will be a tape playing in your head over and over you have to release that  and bluntly give it to God. This is easierr said than done asa Satan of course will try to put the tape back in.

Rebellion is another infection on the family. Rebellion could be defined as going against God's established order of authority. For example the man becoming passive would be rebellion. Further the wife trying to force the husband to submit to her is also rebellion. Further more the children trying to lead/control their parents is also a form of rebellion. Note this really applies in all battle fronts. There is a biblical chain of authoirty that we are all called to be under, rebellion for this causes a large amount of damage that can/will least generations [^b3].

Selfishness is a sin that also effects a marriage heavily. Sometimes this is a child that will separate a husband and a wife. Other times there is a need for a husband and wife to sacrifice for each other to fulfill the needs of the other in various areas. Though this is often applied to the marriage bed  really this applies to all areas beyond just the *obvious* target [^b6].

[^b5]: [[Ephes 4|Ephes 4:26-27]] - this passage gives a biblical principle for children 
[^b6]: [[1 Cor 7|1 Cor 7:1-5]] - this passage is on a husband and wife fulfilling each other's needs although this applies to sex it can apply to so much more.


## Dealing with the Problem
Ok we now know the problem great. How do we handle the problem.

First obviously we need to get in line. That means man and wife need to line up biblically and then if this is the case they can then help get their children to line back in. [^note1] As parents furthermore you are called to encourage your children to good. I consider this like lining your kid up in the right direction. Much of the suggested correction today is focused on telling a kid what not to do... not what to do that creates massive issues as these children get older because they become directionless and a "ship tossed in the wind". But if children are corrected properly **and** are obedient God will bless them and further them. [^b7]

[^note1]: **Note**: I will not be diving too deep here as most of my audience are not married.
[^b7]: [[Col 3|Col 3:18-21]] - this is another passage on the order and direction of marriage as well as proper correction of children. 

## Generational Cycles
One thing i want to hit on is generational cycles, specifically i will be targeting abuse as this is something i have history/understanding of, but this applies to other areas too. First a generation cycle is a sin that a child inherits from their parents and often causes a great deal of harm. The severity of the cycle may vary, but it will review. It is important as Christians that we break these familial chains doing our best to break these chains. I will also not that this cannot be done in a single generation either. From my estimates it usually takes about three. The first being the parent taking that first step and making an honest attempt at change. they will not be perfect and some harm will still be caused **becuase they do not know better**, but I believe that God does in fact bless this because the child then goes and looks back understanding better the good and the bad and maybe has a understanding of how to avoid the pitfalls their parents landed in. This results in the grandchildren finally being relativly free. There is still some left but these things will be diluted. All of this could be reflected in a Christians sanctification journey.

# Next Week
We are going to talk about stronghold within the [[../Church|Church]].

# Review
We have been studying the Spiritual War between [[God]] and Satan. We understand that Satan's goal is to disable Christians such that we cannot bring glory to God.
We have more recently been studying how we fight in the war, including concepts like getting authority and placing the [[Armor of God]]. Furthermore we studied individual strongholds last week.

We also discussed last week Phycology and the church and how they relate. After a discussion with my brother something to consider is that a proper phycologist is not going to bring in religion. One item that is useful from a Christian phycologist is that they will have a better understanding of what you believe and be able to highlight things and use the Bible on occasion, but almost all cases that is true regardless of a phycologists religion. Thus I would advise *avoiding* any phycologist that advertises themselves as a Christian phycologist. Not because they are bad but because they are similar to a naturopath. A good one is great but a bad one could get you killed.
# Today
Today we are going to go further and try to combat familial strongholds. These includes things like divorce, abuse and how we can break them.

## Satan's Attack on the Family
It is not surprise that Satan is attacking family today. This goes from negating the need for marriage in most people's eye such that between 2000 and 2022  the marriage rate per 1000 people has gone down from 8.2 to 6.2 [^source1]. Note that there are some things to consider here both spiritually and politically. But we will target these things later.

### Degradation of Marriage
With-in my lifetime the concept of what marriage is, why you get married, when/if you get divorced have all been degredated within the US. So lets start with the Biblical definition of marriage.

Marriage is the union of one man, and one woman for life for the purpose of helping each other bring glory to God in their conjoined calling in both practical ministry and child rearing. [^b1]

#### Biblical Familial Rolls
Furthermore within a family there are three rolls.

The Man/Husband
1. Love his wife as Christ loves the Church and love her as much as he loves himself [^b2]
2. To lead the family in all areas [^b3]

The Woman/Wife
1. Submit to her husband [^b3] **NOTE**: that biblical submission here is a topic we may not get too deep on

The children
1. Obey Your Parents
2. Leave and Cleave [^b1]

Satan's first attack on marriage was to reverse these roles. This can show both in the husband and wife even today. [^b4]
1. Satan Made Adam passive sitting on the sidelines
2. Satan made Eve take over leadership

If you are not in the role that God has called you to Satan has a method to attack. This is especially true in marriage and the church (we will hit on that later). Ironically when we go back to the curses brought on by sin it even grantees strife within marriage. No longer is man and wife completing each other and trying to swap roles. Including the man becoming passive or not leading lovingly and the wife striving to become the leader of the family.

[^b1]: [[Gen 2|Gen 2:24-25]] - this is the definition of marriage based on the scriptures and the first marriage between [[ðŸ§‘Adam]] and [[ðŸ§‘Eve]].
[^b2]: [[Ephes 5|Ephes 5:21-33]] - this is where we get a biblical definition of the man and woman's roll in marriage
[b3]: [[1 Cor 11|1 Cor 11:3]] - this verse highlights in the middle of a discussion of head coverings the role of a husband
[^b4]: [[Gen 3]] - this passage is the fall of man and the resulting consequences

### The Infections within Modern Families

Satan has most decently infected the family, even the first family had massive issues (see [[ðŸ§‘Cain]] and [[ðŸ§‘Abel]]). For example Satan will use long lived anger to infect the family  planting seeds of hatred. These sometimes can start as a slight back when children are young, some of this could be on the parents as they should teach children (when they are young) to deal with anger and seek forgivness and deal with problems ASAP as biblically recommended [^b5]. 

[^b5]: [[Ephes 4|Ephes 4:26-27]] - this passage gives a biblical principle for children

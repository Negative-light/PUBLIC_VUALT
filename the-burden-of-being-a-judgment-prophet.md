# Last Week
Last week we hit on the rhetorical questions [[God]] gives to [[p-nation-of-israel|Israel]]. This is focused on the fate worse than death that God is depting for the nation through [[../p-jeremiah]]. The desicration of ones body is like Hell.
# This Week
This week we are going to see what the burden of the message of judgment *should* carry on someone. Jeremiah is in great pain.


## Jeremiah's Pain
Jeremiah starts with a lament regretting his birth because he is mistreated [^1]. This is simple single verse but the fact is that we need to understand the gospel will bring hate. Why? Because there is judgement. I posit that why people are so sensative to this judgement is that people know at some basic level it is true and that judgment requires change.

Try bringing up change in a church fill with somewhat like minded Christians... have you tried it? That is how you get church splits. So much more should we have pity on those who are angry at the gospel because of the pain of sin. Their heats hard and callous not willing to hear the truth of the Gospel **yet**. May we pray for them that God will send out the tillers to help with the planting. May the tools smiths work hard and fast that there is no delay. (...that sounds like spurgon)

## God's Judgment on Jeremiah
The next bit we see Jeremiah being judged by God not being spared from the captivity to come [^2].

## Jeremiah Calls to God
This next bit Jeremiah asks God to just his enemies. Are we willing to ask God to judge those who server us [^3]. Are we willing to ask God to handle our enemies those that wish us to fail [^4]. Jeremiah though is clearly bitter against God. 

There are other things to not. Jeremiah is not evil fully. He has a real and true desire for God in here. We cannot deny that Jeremiah is acting out of faith, but has lost sight of the goal in the long term. he is seeking God's work and living a righteous life. We should seek to do these things because they are good things.

The point is that if we look at who the focus is on it is on *him* not on God. Are you being righteous because "That is what good Christians do and I am a good Christian". OR Are you doing good because God has called you to do good, because God has been good to you, because you have been changed by God.

## God calls him to repent
Although Jeremiah's anger seems right in asking God to judge his meemies. Jeremiah has wandered away from the message he was called to send. he has become selfish focusing on himself within the message of sharing the Gospel [^5]. Here is where we are really camping out today.

Jeremiah is being called for judgment but God is offering to return him. We are sinners we have fallen apart and fled from God. This is both individually and corporately. the judgment of God has for those that follow him is a emptiness and lack of service. God removes you from the ability to share the Gospel. The thing is that God will reset you to be strong if you repent.

This is something that must be done individually first. Revival starts **not** with a pastor on Sunday morning, **NOT** with a big tent over one weekend. it starts with each of us one by one repenting. Then as we repent and server those around us the chain reaction begins. This spark is what starts revival, it is never massive or flashy but when things get going it goes and no one can deny that it is an act of God.


We are going to see next week Jeremiah is still *very* young and hasn't married yet. Jeremiah is young, it is foolish to thing we are differnt. TBH I have been here, oftne repeatedly. Have you? Are you willing to repent and allow God to rebuilt the ministries you server in? Is this not What God has called us too?

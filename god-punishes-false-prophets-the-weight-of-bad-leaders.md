# Last Week
Last week we looked at a drought ravaging [Israel](../p-nation-of-israel.md) which  [God](God.md) uses as a symbol for how Israel is spiritually without life. The focus here is God calling the people to repent even  [p-jeremiah](../p-jeremiah.md) was begging for mercy upon his nation.

The final call is to consider if God is a "resident alien" in our life.

# This Week
This week we see many false prophets have been countering the message of judgment saying that it will not happen. God calls for these people to be judged

[^m1]: [Jer 14:11-16](Jer%2014.md)
[^m2]: [Jer 14:17-22](Jer%2014.md) 
## False Prophets are Preaching
This weeks lesson starts with God calling Jeremiah to not pray for mercy on Israel (Judah). Jeremiah instead mentions that other "prophets" are saying there will not have sword or famine and there will only be peace (during a drought too) God then spells out punishment for the prophets [^m1]. Remember that God also did the same type of command earlier to Jeremiah [^b1] [^matthew-poole]. This means that Israel has reach the point they have committed the "sin that leads to death" [^b2] [^guzik]. 


Something in here to consider is that God is Ignoring their service and sacrifice. 
As Christians this looks like God ignoring or ending your ability to serve because of sins you are living in.

On the topic of False prophets they are clearly lying to "tickle the ears" of the people and the government leaders [^matthew-poole]. 
They are then getting a "worse" judgment of having no one to bury them, meaning that their family would be completely gone. They will have no legacy.

[^b1]: [Jer 7:16-19](jer%207.md) and [Jer 11:14](Jer%2011.md)
[^b2]: [1 John 5:14-16](1%20John%205.md)

## A Lament
The next section is a lament on the drought and false prophets topic [^m2]. This section is not clearly specified if it is God or Jeremiah with the exception of verse 19[^garner-howes]. A key too look at si that the prophet and priest the leadership of this body has gone into "unknown lands" they are no longer being consistent with God's word [^ellicott]. When we consider this it highlights that the morality of the nation was again fully decayed away [^matthew-henry].


## Applications
We have several applications here but I think we should focus on the topic of false prophets for the time we are entering as a church.
1. The False Prophets were only worried about making the people feel happy.
    1. Do you listen to people who *convict you*. Not only of your sin, but spots that you are not perfect in, that you are not being improved.
        1. On this topic we see the idea that Iron Sharpens Iron. The truth is that as Christians we should not only be convicted of sin. We should be convicted to fulfill our calling
    2. Do you keep those who lead you accountable to stick to the *Word*?
        1. This isn't just the Pastor it applies to all teachers. Remember that a teacher is judged more heavily for what they have taught.
2. The people had complete moral decay
    1. Do you believe that God will bring in bad leaders for bodies that need to be judged?

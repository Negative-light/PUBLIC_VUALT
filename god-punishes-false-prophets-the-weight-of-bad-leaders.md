# Last Week
Last week we looked at a drought ravaging [Israel](../%F0%9F%8F%99%EF%B8%8F%F0%9F%8F%99%EF%B8%8FNation%20of%20Israel.md) which  [God](God.md) uses as a symbol for how Israel is spiritually without life. The focus here is God calling the people to repent even  [ðŸ§‘Jeremiah](%F0%9F%A7%91Jeremiah.md) was begging for mercy upon his nation.

The final call is to consider if God is a "resident alien" in our life.

# This Week
This week we see many false prophets have been countering the message of judgment saying that it will not happen. God calls for these people to be judged

[^m2]: [Jer 14:17-22](Jer%2014.md) 
## False Prophets are Preaching
This weeks lesson starts with God calling Jeremiah to not pray for mercy on Israel (Judah). Jeremiah instead mentions that other "prophets" are saying there will not have sword or famine and there will only be peace (during a drought too) God then spells out punishment for the prophets [^m1]. Remember that God also did the same type of command earlier to Jeremiah [^b1] [^matthew-poole]. This means that Israel has reach the point they have committed the "sin that leads to death" [^b2] [^guzik].

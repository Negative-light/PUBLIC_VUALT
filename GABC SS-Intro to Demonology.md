# Review
In this study we are analyzing the spiritual war for Glory between God and Satan including where it is fought. We have also taken time to analyze how we are given aid through angels and how Satan operates to attack us. It is important to remember as always with this study victory is found in **Christ Alone**.

# Today
Let's start with the simple part. Demons are real, they do operate in our world in a ordered structure and they operate nothing like the movies in Hollywood. One of my rules of thumb is that if everyone is calling it demonic it probably isn't and thus I should try to understand it. 

Things that have been called demonic that are not demonic inherently include but are not limited to
1. Dancing - yes, i have heard this one. No its not inherently demonic
2. PokÃ©mon - though it uses characters from the Japanese Mythos the structure and operations of a church is more related to pagan idolatry
3. Video Games - though I am certain there are some demonic video games this is not true for all things
4. D & D/TTRPGs - these are story telling devices made by people for other people to use. The only way for it to become demonic is for those that are playing the game to make it so.
5. The recent picture of King Charles the 3rd [^cite1] - by splitting the image in half mirroring it and turning it upside down there appears to be a goat skull in the image. I simple do not have words for how crazy this sounds 

[^cite1]: [Charles III Unveiled his First Official Portrait, The Smithsonian](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/is-king-charles-iiis-first-official-portrait-too-red-180984364/#:~:text=The%20first%20official%20portrait%20of,into%20a%20matching%20red%20backdrop.)

Why is it so prevalent that Christians call things demonic that are not. It is because most Christians are not taught the purpose of demons in the Bible and how they operate. This results in a lot of us becoming misguided and truthfully not being able to distinguish between a neutral thing and a enemy. The biggest of the issues though is the fear of demons that the church has, this is large and genuine fear that is obsessive at points [^note1].

Key terms for today are
- Possession - when a demon inhabits a person. Because a Christian is filled with the Holy Spirit they cannot become possessed
- Oppression - when a demon is tormenting/attacking a person. Christians can be oppressed by demons.


[^note1]: Note: this extends from person experiences where it has seemed the church went through a phase of being obsessed with calling things demonic. This seems to have started in the late 80s and extended into the mid to late 2000s. I think this is also directly responsible for the heavy increase in paganism today.

## What do we know?
Although there are many texts describing demonic entities and there are known demonic entities most of this is not important to 99% of Christians [^note2]. Overall we know that demons are personal entities with intellect, personality, desires and a will (this holds true for angels as well) [^b1], we see these when demons recognized Jesus and begged for mercy before him before He cast them out of a man. 
We also know that it is super important for person who is freed of demons to be lead to Christ soon (this is usually very common) as to avoid us putting them in a worse position [^b1]. 


[^note2]: Note: This is based on those that are called to have a deeper  understanding of demonology and are called to be more direct in dealing with demons. These people are *very* rare and one should not take the gifting of this lightly. The primary gift i am aware of is being a Seer which means you are far more sensitive to the spiritual world. This being said before you go deeper I **strongly** suggest having time to pray, fast and get close with [[God]] and be 100% on what that calling will look like.
[^b1]: [[Luke 8|Luke 8:26-39]] - This passage is on the man who was possessed by a demon and healed by [[../30-Spiritual/33-Resources/33.10-People/jesus|ðŸ‘¼Jesus]]

## What do they do?
Demons are servants of Satan and are frequently called "unclean spirits" in the Bible. Similar to how angels do functions for the operations of God, demons assist in executing the [[GABC SS-Strategies Satan Uses| strategies of Satan]]. A key part being corrupting the truth and seeding false teachers in the church [^b1a]. If they are not affecting the church they will attack the society by attacking individuals sexuality, this is usually the primary direction for corruption of societies [^b1b].

[^b1a]: [[1 Tim 4|1 Tim 4:1]] - this verse talks about how some will be deceived by spirits and doctrines of demons
  [[1 John 4|1John 4:1]] - This verse calls us to test every spirit of if they are following the scripture. This is the primary way to thwart a false teacher.
[^b1b]: [[1 Cor 7|1 Cor 7:5]] - This verse is to married couples to not open the door to temptation via not spending "time" together depriving each other of physical needs.
    [[Rev 18|Rev 18:2-3]] - This verse talks about one of the few known individual demons, the spirit of Babylon which  is especially dedicated to sexual sin. This verse specifically calls out how she will fall.
## Demons and Phycology
One thing that is hinted at in the book, but I feel needs a deeper  explanation is that the primary way demons show up is insanity and sever mental issues. Lets start with a clear line **not all mental illness are demons**. Especially things like Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Bipolar Disorder (BPD), Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). There are several reason why I have come to this conclusion but the primary element is that none of these show any symptoms similar to those posed by demons within the Bible. There is one disorder (Schizophrenia) that I believe one who is demon possessed would be diagnosed with today, but even this is not a 100% chance. Schizophrenia create a chemical disturbance in the brain and thus can be tested for, therefore I would say that demon possession would likely be diagnosed as Schizophrenia, but we should still be wise about it.

None of this is to say that demons also do take advantage of mental issues people have ranging from those mentioned above to common anxiety, depression and even stress. That is called oppression meaning that a demon is taking advantage of a natural tendency of the human body. For some of these disorders especially it is important to be wise in how we handle them (currently this is ASD and ADHD but others will come around) [^note3].

I desire to end by reminding you that we do not fight against people but against spiritual beings and that is what our focus should be on is helping people who are hurting and allow them to heal such that they can glorify God all the more [^b2]. Especially given that suicidality is one way demons oppress people [^b3] and I believe that a wrong view of demons will make this worse.

[^note3]: Note: I will also say that ASD and ADHD are really disability as a byproduct of societal structure if you analyze how those disorders operate they have a  ton of utility in a agrarian culture which is probably why there were not diagnosable until very recently with people only being call "a little odd"
[^b2]: [[Ephes 6|Ephes 6:12]] - This verse is about how we do not fight against flesh and blood.
[^b3]: [[Rev 9|Rev 9:3-6]] - This verse is about those "locust" demons from Revelation that oppress the people of earth and make them desire death
# Next Week
Next week we are going to Revelation to see the final defeat of Satan.

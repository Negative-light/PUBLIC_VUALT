# Last Week
Last week we were looking at a prophecy [[God|God]] had given [[p-jeremiah|Jeremiah]]  about the coming destruction of the [[Southern Kingdom]] by [[üèôÔ∏èBabylon|Babylon]]. 

# This Week
So this week we roll back in time and see how Jeremiah is persecuted for his prophecies and we see the story of another prophet ([[üßëUriah|Uriah]]) who is also persecuted. This would be around 605 BC [^matthew-poole] [^john-gill].

This is for those that study scripture something important to note. Unlike modern story telling where we love a good timeline (should I make a FANAF **LORE** joke). During this timeframe people would arrange events thematically and cover the actual events not necessarily the order of events [^john-calvin]

## Jeremiah's Story

### The Prophecy
We start with Jeremiah going throughout [[city-jerusalem|Jerusalem]] given the same prophecy of judgment. We should note that this chapter starts ~ 3 years before chapter 25 [^1].  This may have actually been at a festival based on the fact God called him to use the courtyard of the [[First Temple]] [^ellicott].

A secondary element that I think is worth emphasizing is that Jeremiah was clearly prescribed to not dilute the word of God. I do think in 2025 we have full reason to not follow this idea. But if we are to be faithful witnesses we shouldn't be diluting the word of God [^matthew-henry]. This word of course was to compare the temple to Shiloh which was used for curing among other nations, and the previous cite for worship to God [^enduring-word]. But still we see that God wants to redeem the nation. The purpose of this statement is that people would repent [^garner-howes].

### The Response
Following this the people since Jeremiah accusing him of being a false prophet and seeking to put him to death because he was "attacking the house of God" [^2]. Now I think there are several layers we can unpack here. The charge is that Jeremiah had attacked the temple which had lost the spirit. I don't think I need to guide y'all where my mind went. People attack pastors for not wearing a suit, or having tattoos or focus on the past of the church. And if you touch any of the sacred cows you are an evil person.

These people had made "church" to be a source of pride in their life. And thus any attack against the norms of "church" is an attack on them, and therefore the "god" they had built in their mind. Thus he was a blasphemer and traitor [^garner-howes] [^enduring-word]. Mind that this also reminds me of [[jesus|Jesus]] and how he was attacked after questioning the norms of the [[Pharisees]]. This includes how they only focused on the bad part of the prophecy of Jeremiah and how the Pharisees never saw the good news but only saw people as worthless sinners while they were righteous because of their position [^matthew-henry]

### The Judgment
Now we see Jeremiah defend himself making it clear that he is preaching God's words (and thereby the other prophets are false). Jeremiah stands boldly and submits to the possibly of his own death. The older men who remembered the time of [[üßëHezekiah|Hezekiah]] and they point out that killing Jeremiah might bring judgment upon themselves [^3] 

First we look that Jeremiah focuses his defense on God and submits to authority. Knowing that he is being fully obedient he understands that there are two options. To quote [[üßëPaul|Paul]] "to live is Christ and to die is gain" [^4].

Now we look at the leaders response that they realize this guys words align with other prophecies from back in the time of Hezekiah. But if we just look at how Hezekiah reacted when he learned that the nation need to repent vs these leaders. It is the polar opposite despite having the same data. This showing a contrast of knowledge of God and wisdom that comes from God. 

## Uriah's Story
Now we see the story of the prophet Uriah who was also speaking the same things of Jeremiah. But rather than responding with boldness he responded in fear. He runs to [[üìåEgypt|Egypt]] and is drawn back by [[üßëJehoiakim|Jehoiakim's]] men. This leads to his death.

Now we don't have the timeline here. Was this sequential or was it that Uriah was prophesying while Jeremiah was under arrest. We don't know but we have the clear implication that fear lead to Uriah's death while faith lead to Jeremiah's protection. 

## Application

- Faith Over Fear
    - This has been something that I have been convicted over a lot recently. I am going to be honest I cannot teach y'all how to not be fearful. I just know I need to change. And this text gives us an example of what Faith and Fear result in for believers.
- Knowledge vs Wisdom
    - A second element that stuck out to me is that the judges. The older men. They *knew* what to do yet they did not do it. The refused to turn the nation to God. Which had succeeded not even that long ago under [[üßëJosiah|Josiah]] and under Hezekiah
- Boldly Teach
    - We only get a small exherpt of Jeremiah's teaching but we know that he taught all the word of God. Although we may not all have a similar calling we should be able to boldly present the Gospel when it is needed. Understanding that it may have a cost, but not turning back
- You are called
    - Here I want to focus on the last verse where we see Ahikam who provided and protected Jeremiah who was probably still socially under attack. sometimes being a leader is supporting the "public face". One itme the PSC has taught me is that pastors need lots of care and are defently human. Prayerfully we will see a pastor in the near future. We should make sure he is taken care of.


# Next Week
We will start chapter 27.

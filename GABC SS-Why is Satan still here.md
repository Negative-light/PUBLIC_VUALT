# Review
This study has covered the spiritual war for glory between [God](God) and Satan. We have discussed the importance of the right worldview, where Satan tries to attack. Following this we covered angles and demons. But the important thing to remember is that **victory** is found in Jesus.

# Today
Today we really hit on Satan's fall and how he is already judged. But first we are going to cover *why* he is still here.

## Why is Satan Here

Satan is here to bring glory to God. That is plain and simple. But there are specific ways God uses Satan to show His glory.

### Testing
The book of Job is an example of how God uses Satan to test the man, but Job held faith. This is a concept of being "sifted" or tested. God is separating the bad parts from the good and strengthening you in him. We see an example of this form Paul's thorn in the flesh which he asked God to be removed, but after God refused Paul learned the lesson that God's strength is highlighted in our weakness and the major reason for this is that the physical issue was a way to prevent Paul from swelling with Pride [^b1].

[^b1]: [[2 Cor 12|2 Cor 12:7-10]] - this a passage covers Paul's thorn in the flesh and him seeking God.

### Judgment
The second method that [[God]] uses Satan is judgment. We see this with [[King Saul]] who at some point but after rejecting God Saul is driving to madness by Satan [^b2].

[^b2]: [[1 Sam 16|1 Sam 16:1-23]] - This passage shows the anointing of [[King David]] and the beginning of the downfall of Saul.

## Satan is Already Defeated
For the next bit we go back to the fall of man and look at the early sins of Cain and the resulting opening.

### God's I Will statements
Satan had 5 I will statements that happened when he dedicated himself to overthrow God (and thus was thrown out of heaven) [^b3] but God gives two I wills regarding Satan. First God said I will come to the earth as a man through Eve, second God said that despite Satan bruising his heal He will crush Satan's head [^b4].

[^b3]: [[Isa 14|Isa 14:13-14]] - This passage has the 5 I will statements of Satan.
[^b4]: [[Gen 3|Gen 3:15]] - This passage holds the prophecy that [[../30-Spiritual/33-Resources/33.10-People/ðŸ‘¼Jesus|ðŸ‘¼Jesus]] would come and destroy Satan.

### Satan's Attempts
Satan obviously doesn't like the fact that he is already defeated so he tried to thwart God's plan. We see that God was pleased by the sacrifice of Abel and not with  Cain [^b5], Satan took advantage of this by planting the idea of murder in Cain this theoretically would stop God's plan [^b6]. But Satan didn't compensate for the soon to be Seth who is the ancestor to all of us today (as he was the ancestor of Noah).

[^b5]: [[Gen 4|Gen 4]] - This chapter covers the story of [[ðŸ§‘Cain]] and [[ðŸ§‘Abel]]
[^b6]: [[1 John 3|1 John 3:12]] - This verse further explains *why* Cain killed Abel

### Jesus' Victory
Once we get to the cross we then see Jesus crushing the head of Satan [^b7], this victory also removed curse of sin which can be found in the Law and our inability to keep it [^b8].

[^b7]: [[John 12|John 12:30-32]] - This verse has Jesus mention the ruler of the world (Satan) being Cast out and people being called to him (for the sake of Salvation).
[^b8]: [[Gal 3|Gal 3:10-14]] - This passage covers how the Law and Sin relate and that because we cannot keep all of it we are cursed. But Jesus being put on the cross took on that curse for us especially the gentiles.

## Satan's End
In Revelation John sees how God plans to end the world and there are many great things in that book that Christians can apply including some warnings of what we see today. But Today we focus on Satan's final destruction. First he is thrown down from heaven [^b9] then he is confined for the Millennial reign [^b10] and faintly destroyed at the battle at Armageddon.

[^b9]: [[Rev 12| Rev 12:7-12]] - Here we see Satan and his minions cast away awaiting their final judgment
[^b10]: [[Rev 20]] - This chapter covers the final destruction of Satan and his minions. First he is imprisoned for 1000 years the n released to deceived and finally thrown in ot the lake of fire and brimstone.

# Next Week
In the coming weeks we are really going to hit on the applicaiton section of this book.

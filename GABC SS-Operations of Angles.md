## Organization
Throughout scripture we know that angles are known to be army [^b1]. An army is divided up into ranks, this is hinted at through terms like archangel. [^g1] This structure is spelled out for those that we are against and it would be safe to say that this structure is replicated in the angels as well [^b2]. In the creation of [[Ark of the Convenant]] there are two Cherubim [^b3]. There are also the continuously worshipers and direct guardians of God taht are found in Isaiah [^b4].

[^b1]: [[Matt 26|Matt26:54]] - Angles being refereed to in a sense that makes it clear they are a army
[^g1]: [Strongs G743 Bible Hub](https://biblehub.com/greek/743.htm)
[^b2]: [[Ephes 6|Ephes 6:12]] - this is the description of the structure of the demonic army. [[Col 1|Col 1:16]] - This verse also hinds at God creating four levels of leadership both in the visible and invisible space.
[^b3]: [[Exod 25|Exod 25:20]] - This verse just has the reference to the cherubim that are on the Ark of the Covenant, but the full chapter includes the full descirption of the ark

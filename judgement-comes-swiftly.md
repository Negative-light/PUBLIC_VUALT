# Review
Last week we took the time to focus on how [God](God.md) will forgo destruction of [Israel](../%F0%9F%8F%99%EF%B8%8F%F0%9F%8F%99%EF%B8%8FNation%20of%20Israel.md) if they repented. This of course we understand can be extrapolated ot God's

This weeks focus is focused on this imagery in the two prophecies.
## A Prophecy
The fist section here talks about how the judgment from the "north".  There is a call for armament with the urgency to get within the safety of the city walls. Here we see Babylon described as a lion thing it to how Satan affects Christians [^b3]. This image shows how God is sending something unavoidable and a outright calamity [^b1]
## A Break
We see for a moment that Jeremiah stops takes a moment to cry out to God [^b4]. This being said this could be in light of false prophets [^blue-letter-bible] [^enduring-word]. Others think that Jeremiah is taking a moment because of the grief of seeing this coming judgment [^study-light-1] [^sutdy-light] that ultimately Jeremiah was feeling discouraged.

Either way I think this ties into something we as Christians should see that we at times will be discouraged in what we are called to do. And that at times we will sit and desire to (and possibly even do) blame God for the judgment happening. Or feel bad for God because of how people might feel about Him after a coming judgment, this is something I think is worthwhile because first we are human and second there is a desire to see things done right. But even though we are discouraged we sit, take a breath and recoup so that we might see God.
## A Warning
This next section makes it clear *how much* the speed of the coming judgment will be. They are described as coming like clouds. Their horses are like eagles. This is all focused on God "penetrating" the heart of the people using this judgment [^b2]. Overall this passage focuses on this concept of Repenting lest you are captured from these "watchers". But if we take a moment to look back at the last verse it focuses on two parts, your judgment if on yourself and the other part is that it should and will eat your heart. Some consider that this passage talks about how sin has infected all of life [^blue-letter-bible] while others want to focus on how bitter this judgment will be [^blue-letter-bible-1]

## Closing Thoughts
This passage kinda makes me think of a hurricane. Back when Hurricane Ida came through our area this is the first time I ever experience a true Hurricane and the first time I experienced the eye of a storm. Overall this passage follows that structure, though the eye is more focused on the morning an d calling out to God. I feel like this is something we *should* do as Christians. When we go through a storm and there is a moment to breath we should call out to God, we should seek him. Why? Because the eye of the storm is **not** then end of the storm. that is not the time to start rebuilding because what you rebuild will be knocked down again. Rather it is the time to secure what you do have left ensuring that more damage cannot happen.
# Next Week
We are going to analyze [üßëJeremiah](%F0%9F%A7%91Jeremiah.md)'s response to seeing this coming judgment and see how that applies to Christians

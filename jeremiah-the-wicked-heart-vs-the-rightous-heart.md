# Last Week
Last week we explored the topic of addiction. How [God](God.md) told the [Southern Kingdom](Southern%20Kingdom.md) that their punishment would include them **continuing deeper** into the idolatry they were already doing. But this includes a hopeful message of the future redemption that God would do with them.

# This Week
This week we are looking at a "inverse" to the story of Psalm 1, the tree planted in the desert [^1]. This goes into the concepts of the heart.

## The Sin of Judah
This chapter opens with God spelling out a part of the judgment to [Jeremiah](../p-jeremiah.md). This includes what to me seems like a noted nostalgia filter that the people would have on the idol worship places. Ultimately God removes the blessings of the land He had given them. [^2]

To add some history to this we are nearing the end at this point, so the children at this time would be young adults [^garner-howes], thus the Asherah poles that were hosted in large Groves [^ellicott] would be imbedded in their mind just like the beauty of old chapels/malls etc. are in ours today.

The nature of Judah at this point was so bad that their sin was "written" on their heart. A direct counter to God's commands to Israel for them to have the Word written on their hearts [^3]. This really is saying the sin was no longer just a blemish but was etched into stone [^enduring-word] and they couldn't be redeemed [^matthew-poole].

The point is that the heart of the nation was so hard that the people couldn't repent [^john-calvin], but something we don't see that they would have is the word translated relinquish in the CSB means to "drop something" [^4] or release it. Meaning that these blessings are not gone forever, heck this word is sometimes translated to allow things to rest.

## The Tree Planted in the Desert
Here we get to the part i opened with. Jeremiah is given a message that opens with a curse to those who trust man kind (as Israel was with Egypt at this time [^garner-howes] [^john-calvin]) this person is compared to a tree planed in the desert (or the Arabah). This counters the second person being described as a tree planted by the river, a callback to the first Psalm [^1].

The clear purpose of this is that God is contrasting those who trust others and those that Trust God, making it clear who is better off [^ellicott]. Mind that there is some imagry here that depends on what tree God is talking about, which coudl be the *arar* or Sodom Apple [^enduring-word] which can survive and be green out in the desert but produces a toxic and disguising fruit [^5] 

[Sodom Apple Tree](https://www.daveadamson.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Israel_July16_DSCF5356-2-232x300.jpg) [Sodom Apple Fruit](https://www.daveadamson.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Israel_July16_DSCF5346-300x300.jpg)

Similar to how the Sodom apple is a good looking fruit that is both empty and toxic our life without God beocmes like this.

## The state of the Human Heart
This next bit opens with a common verse on the deceitfulness of the heart, but following that God states how He judges the heart and ends with a description of how we can find sanctuary in God [^6].

I like the way Matthew Henry puts this

> " ... The heart, the conscience of man, in his corrupt state, is deceitful above all things. It calls evil good, and good evil; and cries peace to those to who it doesn't belong. ..."
\- Matthew Henry [^matthew-henry]


This is a simple truth that is often forgoten. How often do we do things just because we feel it is the right thing to do. We "follow" our heart. But the thing is that we shouldn't do that. As a Christian hopefully your heart does desire good things, but good things are not the *right* thing. 

For this I am going to pull in an example of fleeing sin. Although fleeing sin is a good thing, you **must** do it as a Christian. But we as Christians shouldn't just flee sin we should follow Jeremiah here in a moment, we must run to God for running to God is the great thing. This is how we avoid the emptiness of life. We can chase after good things like work, popularity, a family but it is all a "broken cistern".

## Seek the Shelter of the King
This final bit is Jeremiah's plea for God to heal and lead him protecting him from persecution [^7]. One element of interested is Jeremiah does make claims of himself to God, I don't think acknowledging  what you have done before God is a bad thing, but remember that you are focusing between you and God. The thing is that Jeremiah was trying to be truthful with God authentic and fully obedient.

This is something we should desire to become as Christians to have a relationship that is good and healthy with God. Acknowledging the pains of being a prophet but leaving the judgment to God [^enduring-word]. 


## Questions
- What are tell tail signs of Christians who are living the Psalm 1 abundant life that God promises to those who trust him? How does this counter the "desert bush" from Jeremiah 17?
- What are good habits that Christians *should* build to avoid the deception of the heart?
- What are ways to build a character like Jeremiah to quickly turn to God?


# Next Week
We are going to finish up Jeremiah 17.

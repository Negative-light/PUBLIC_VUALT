# Last Week
Last week we explored the topic of addiction. How [God](God.md) told the [Southern Kingdom](Southern%20Kingdom.md) that their punishment would include them **continuing deeper** into the idolatry they were already doing. But this includes a hopeful message of the future redemption that God would do with them.

# This Week
This week we are looking at a "inverse" to the story of Psalm 1, the tree planted in the desert [^1]. This goes into the concepts of the heart.

## The Sin of Judah
This chapter opens with God spelling out a part of the judgment to [Jeremiah](../p-jeremiah.md). This includes what to me seems like a noted nostalgia filter that the people would have on the idol worship places. Ultimately God removes the blessings of the land He had given them. [^2]

To add some history to this we are nearing the end at this point, so the children at this time would be young adults [^garner-howes], thus the Asherah poles that were hosted in large Groves [^ellicott] would be imbedded in their mind just like the beauty of old chapels/malls etc. are in ours today.

## The Tree Planted in the Desert
Here we get to the part i opened with. Jeremiah is given a message that opens with a curse to those who trust man kind (as Israel was with Egypt at this time [^garner-howes] [^john-calvin]) this person is compared to a tree planed in the desert (or the Arabah)

# Last Week
Last week we explored the topic of addiction. How [God](God.md) told the [Southern Kingdom](Southern%20Kingdom.md) that their punishment would include them **continuing deeper** into the idolatry they were already doing. But this includes a hopeful message of the future redemption that God would do with them.

# This Week
This week we are looking at a "inverse" to the story of Psalm 1, the tree planted in the desert [^1]. This goes into the concepts of the heart.

## The Sin of Judah
This chapter opens with God spelling out a part of the judgment to [Jeremiah](../p-jeremiah.md). This includes what to me seems like a noted nostalgia filter that the people would have on the idol worship places. Ultimately God removes the blessings of the land He had given them. [^2]

To add some history to this we are nearing the end at this point, so the children at this time would be young adults [^garner-howes], thus the Asherah poles that were hosted in large Groves [^ellicott] would be imbedded in their mind just like the beauty of old chapels/malls etc. are in ours today.

The nature of Judah at this point was so bad that their sin was "written" on their heart. A direct counter to God's commands to Israel for them to have the Word written on their hearts [^3]. This really is saying the sin was no longer just a blemish but was etched into stone [^enduring-word] and they couldn't be redeemed [^matthew-poole].

The point is that the heart of the nation was so hard that the people couldn't repent [^john-calvin], but something we don't see that they would have is the word translated relinquish in the CSB means to "drop something" [^4] or release it. Meaning that these blessings are not gone forever, heck this word is sometimes translated to allow things to rest.

## The Tree Planted in the Desert
Here we get to the part i opened with. Jeremiah is given a message that opens with a curse to those who trust man kind (as Israel was with Egypt at this time [^garner-howes] [^john-calvin]) this person is compared to a tree planed in the desert (or the Arabah). This counters the second person being described as a tree planted by the river, a callback to the first Psalm [^1].

The clear purpose of this is that God is contrasting those who trust others and those that Trust God, making it clear who is better off [^ellicott]. Mind that there is some imagry here that depends on what tree God is talking about, which coudl be the *arar* or Sodom Apple [^enduring-word] which can survive and be green out in the desert but produces a toxic and disguising fruit [^5] 

![Sodom Apple Tree](https://www.daveadamson.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Israel_July16_DSCF5356-2-232x300.jpg) ![Sodom Apple Fruit](https://www.daveadamson.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Israel_July16_DSCF5346-300x300.jpg)

Similar to how the Sodom apple is a good looking fruit that is both empty and toxic our life without God beocmes like this.

## The state of the Human Heart
This next bit opens with a common verse on the deceitfulness of the heart, but following that God states how He judges the heart and ends with a description of how we can find sanctuary in God [^6].

I like the way Matthew Henry puts this

> " ... The heart, the conscience of man, in his corrupt state, is deceitful above all things. It calls evil good, and good evil; and cries peace to those to who it doesn't belong. ..."
\- Matthew Henry [^matthew-henry]

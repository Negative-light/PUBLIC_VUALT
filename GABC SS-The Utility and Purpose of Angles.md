# Today

Today we are going to dive deeper into the topic of angles or angelology. Some things to note tis that angles are 100% spirit and only adopt human forms temporarily.
## Angels Ministries
Angles have a variety of ministries that they do examples include
- Being Messengers (this is what the word "angle" actually means) [^s1]
    - This includes providing Guidance [^b5]
- Being Protectors of God's people [^b1]
- Being Providers form God [^b3]
- Being executors of God's Judgments [^b4]

The focus of  all angels ministries is like it is for all things to point to Christ [^b10]. They are also the worshipers of got in his throne room [^b11]

[^s1]: [Strong's Greek: 32. á¼„Î³Î³ÎµÎ»Î¿Ï‚ (aggelos) -- an angel, messenger](https://biblehub.com/greek/32.htm)
[^b1]: [[2 Kings 6|2 Kings 6:15-16]] - In this selection these angles were surrounding the town that Elisha was in while they were attacked by the King of Syria
  [[Acts 12|Acts 12:7-10]] - This is when [[ðŸ§‘Peter]] is freed from jail for the second time
[^b3]: [[Matt 4|Matt 4:11]] - This is after [[../30-Spiritual/33-Resources/33.10-People/ðŸ‘¼Jesus|ðŸ‘¼Jesus]] was in the wilderness and had finished this trial did angels come and provide for him
[^b4]: [[Rev 15|Rev 15:7]] - Rev angles are given 7 bowls of judgment and later will spill them out. 
   [[Acts 12|Acts 12:20-23]] - Acts an angle is used to kill Herod Aggripa who is claiming the Glory of God
   [[Ps 103|Ps 103:20]] - This verse spicily talks about how angles do God's word and execute his will.
[^b5]: [[Acts 10]] - Angles bring down the sheet of unclean animals within a vision that started the mission to the Gentiles 
[^b10]: [[Col 1|Col 1:16]] - this verse discuses how all things were made for the sake of Christ this includes angles and demons.
[^b11]: [[Rev 22|Rev 22:8-9]] - This verse is when John is met by an angle that pushes him to Worship God as a "Fellow Servant"
### Spiritual "Ladders"
Next we will discus Spiritual Ladders, in the book Evans ties this into the call of Nathaniel, which is interesting. But the goal is too connect a few things these The Ladder is used to represent God's blessings on earth.

> One  Satan has done successfully is keep us ignorant of God's promises
\- Dr. Tony Evans, "The Battle is the Lords", pg 118

Similar too the necessity of the [[Armor of God]] to Spiritual Warfare God's promises operate as supplies or tactical utilities in our war. Consider it similar to a Army solider calling in for support and a A10 coming in to provide a path to victory. This is the first blessing being shown via "Jacobs Ladder".

The second blessing is the presence of God. Remember that this ladder goes from earth to heaven, **the throne room of God**. The reason this is important is sometimes we miss God providing, guiding or otherwise answering our prayers because we *do not acknowledge his presence* because we are calloused to his presence.

The third blessing is protection for the *purpose God has for you*. For Jacob this was to form the [[Nation of Israel]] that ultimately culminated in the birth of Jesus.  Similarly for you this is the same. This is  also why the Bible hits on the concept of "Do not Fear", as something we face is this idea that "I cannot do X" this is not necessarily and in some cases is a fear response. Rather remember who you are called to be and the God you serve. [^b6]

The final blessing from the ladder is provision from God to do what he has called you to do. This can be blurred if we focus too much on our circumstances and do not focus on God. [^b7] 


Something to note here is that all of the elements of what the ladders do are operated by angles.

[^b6]: [[1 John 4|1 John 4:4]] - "Greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world"
[^b7]: [[1 Kings 19]] - This is the story of God providing for Elijah when he was weak (this also ties into depression and other areas)

#### What this looks like Today
The method of seeing how "Jacobs Ladder" exists today is really just looking back at the scripture and acting out in faith. This can be looked further into Faith in God's Word and Faith in God's Son. The goal here is how to "Open Up Heaven" and have it impact your life. Remember as well that faith will naturally produce a work or a result in your life.
- Faith in God's word is how you "know" what to do. Note that this is part of coloring your worldview. It is our primary counter to temptation.. [^b8]
- Faith in God's son this is a visible clear faith in Christ, God isn't going to provide. Or in how the book puts it "If there is no public confession of Christ before the world there will be no private blessing from Christ in the world". This is to say one should not be ashamed of the Gospel of Christ. [^b9]


[^b8]: [[Matt 4|Matt 4:1-11]] - Jesus temptation and how he uses the scriptures to counter temptation
  [[2 Tim 3|2 Tim 3:16-17]] - This is part of the final call of Paul to Timothy beseeching him to study the scriptures because of its many uses
  [^b9]: [[Rom 1|Romans 1:16]] - "For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth ; to the Jew first and also to the Greek"
    [[Matt 5|Matt 5:13-15]] - Jesus uses the example of believers being salt and light to the world. We should not try to hide that we are followers of Christ because that is counter to our calling as Christians.

##  The Invisible World
The goal of all these elements is for you to  can be summarized in [[Col 3|Col 3:1-2]] where we are called to set our eyes to the things above. Or to color or world view more on the Spiritual Realm rather than the physical realm.
# Take Aways
- We should not be *practical only* Christians (like Elisha's servant). [^b1]
    - The best way to change this is too seek out and be around Christians that want to be *supernatural* in their behavior
- Sometimes God's provision or healing is going to wait till **AFTER** you have completed a trial [^b3]
- Study God's word and have faith in it as being true as it is our primary counter. [^b7]
- Do not live in a manner that you are ashamed 
- Look at the world thought the view of the Spiritual World rather than just the physical world

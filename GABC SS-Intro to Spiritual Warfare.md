Purpose: The purpose of this lesson is to introduce everyone to the book and to seek if they would like to explore this topic further.
    In essence a high level overview of the Book/Concepts mentioned.


Main topic. Spiritual Warfare is real and we are to understand that battle as it effects all areas of our lives.

Key Scriptures come from [[30-Spiritual/BIBLE_CSB_MD/Ephesians/Ephes 6|Ephes 6]], [[30-Spiritual/BIBLE_CSB_MD/Daniel/Dan 4|Dan 4]], [[James 4]], [[30-Spiritual/BIBLE_CSB_MD/Isaiah/Isa 48|Isa 48]],[[30-Spiritual/BIBLE_CSB_MD/Colossians/Col 1|Col 1]], [[30-Spiritual/BIBLE_CSB_MD/1 Timothy/1 Tim 4|1 Tim 4]],

[[Ephes 6|Ephes 6:11-13]] highlights the necessity of putting on the [[Armor of God]] and the nature of our battling being a spiritual conflict.
    - This conflict creates many of the conflicts we have dealt with. That being the degradation of culture through divorce. Addiction to substances and pornography.
    - This conflict is 100% invisible and all we are seeing are symptoms. To fix them in our own lives we must put on the [[Armor of God]] through prayer and faith. This is futher explained in [[Dan 4|Dan 4:26-32]]
        - There will be more on this point later and we will be diving deeper on Ephes 6 in the future.

==Dan 4 is in the story of [[ðŸ§‘Nebuchadnezzar]] having a dream being interpreted by [[ðŸ§‘Daniel]]==

To see the spiritual effects we must have the right worldview for the purpose of the study we will define a world view as follows:
> Worldview - the lens one uses to see reality
\- Tony Evans "The Battle is the Lords" pg 20

By having the wrong worldview we get distracted and this results in the many effects of Satan being able to deceive us. Note that Satan doesn't want you dead or even unsaved, just inactive **not** giving glory to God. [[Isa 48|Isa 48:11]]
    - This results in a call to action. Can people question if you are a Christian. Are you living in a manner that brings Glory to God. Many of us know of a Christian who no one can question, our goal should be to be such a person.

And now we loop back too [[Ephes 6|Ephes 6:10-11]]. Our Strength comes form God alone and through the Blood of Chrsit alone.


Take aways
Worldview = the lens one uses to see reality
If you do not live as if you believe in God everyone has the right to question that. 
Spiritual Warfare is about the Glory of God
Our Victory is found in Jesus Alone

# Review
N/A (First Lesson)
# Today

Purpose: The purpose of this lesson is to introduce everyone to the book and to seek if they would like to explore this topic further.
    In essence a high level overview of the Book/Concepts mentioned.


Main topic. Spiritual Warfare is real and we are to understand that battle as it effects all areas of our lives.

Key Scriptures come from [[Ephesians/Ephes 6|Ephes 6]], [[Daniel/Dan 4|Dan 4]], [[James 4]], [[Isaiah/Isa 48|Isa 48]],[[Colossians/Col 1|Col 1]], [[1 Timothy/1 Tim 4|1 Tim 4]],

## Evidence of the Battle
The overall essence of this study is to really consider that there is the invisible spiritual realm that has a direct impact on the physical world. The Physical world does have some clear evidence of the conflict that occurs. Including divorce, war, abuse, addiction and so on. Currently about 50% of all marriages end in divorce [^cite1] additionally there is a growing trend of there being fewer marriages and relationships [^cite2].

It is important that we understand that our battle is not with individuals rather it is waged mostly in this spiritual world. [^b1]

[^b1]: [[Ephes 6|Ephes 6:12]] - This verse discuses that we are not waging war with the physical but rather are dealing with spiritual powers.
[^cite1]: [Revealing Divorce Statistics In 2024 â€“ Forbes Advisor](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/legal/divorce/divorce-statistics/#sources_section) - This article discuses the current statistics on marriage and divorce
[^cite2]: [Rising Share of U.S. Adults Are Living Without a Spouse or Partner | Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2021/10/05/rising-share-of-u-s-adults-are-living-without-a-spouse-or-partner/)
## The Full Armor of God
[[Ephes 6|Ephes 6:11-13]] highlights the necessity of putting on the [[Armor of God]] and the nature of our battling being a spiritual conflict.
    - This conflict creates many of the conflicts we have dealt with. That being the degradation of culture through divorce. Addiction to substances and pornography.
    - This conflict is 100% invisible and all we are seeing are symptoms. To fix them in our own lives we must put on the [[Armor of God]] through prayer and faith. This is further explained in [[Dan 4|Dan 4:26-32]]
        - There will be more on this point later and we will be diving deeper on Ephes 6 in the future.
## Physical  World
Dan 4 is in the story of [[ðŸ§‘Nebuchadnezzar]] having a dream being interpreted by [[ðŸ§‘Daniel]], the main thing we see here is that many physical "movements" or major moments do have a spiritual counterpart directing it behind the scenes. [^b2]

To see the spiritual effects we must have the right worldview for the purpose of the study we will define a world view as follows:
> Worldview - the lens one uses to see reality
\- Tony Evans "The Battle is the Lords" pg 20

By having the wrong worldview we get distracted and this results in the many effects of Satan being able to deceive us. Note that Satan doesn't want you dead or even unsaved, just inactive **not** giving glory to God. [[Isa 48|Isa 48:11]]
- This results in a call to action. Can people question if you are a Christian. Are you living in a manner that brings Glory to God. Many of us know of a Christian who no one can question, our goal should be to be such a person.

And now we loop back too [[Ephes 6|Ephes 6:10-11]]. Our Strength comes form God alone and through the Blood of Christ alone. We know that Jesus will not leave us of forsake us either so he is fully reliable [^b3] furthermore Christ.

[^b2]: [[Dan 4|Dan 4:26-32]]
[^b3]: [[Matt 28|Matt 28:20]]

# Take aways
1. Worldview = the lens one uses to see reality
2. If you do not live as if you believe in God everyone has the right to question that. 
3. Spiritual Warfare is about the Glory of God
4. Our Victory is found in Jesus Alone

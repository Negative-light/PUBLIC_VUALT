# Concept
This short lesson is a concept for a local meeting of Christians. The goal is to tie the [[Great Commission]] and the [[human-directive|Human Directive]]. How are these two connected. Simple they are both in effect a command to multiple to be fruitful in life and to reproduce.

# Definitions
## The Human Directive
The human directive can be found in Genesis and is the common call to [ðŸ§‘Adam](%F0%9F%A7%91Adam.md) and [ðŸ§‘Eve](%F0%9F%A7%91Eve.md) to "Be Fruitful and Multiply" [^1]

[^1]: [Gen 1:28](Gen%201.md): This is the verse that holds the "human directive" to be fruitful and multiply

## The Great Commission
We find the Great Commission in the last moments [[../30-Spiritual/33-Resources/33.10-People/jesus|ðŸ‘¼Jesus]] spent with his disciples where he told them to "go and make disciples" [^2]. Or go and multiply the number of followers of Christ. Now how we share the [[../Gospel|Gospel]] is explained further in the New Testament and a key of that is to be fruitful. Now unlike the Human directive this fruitfulness was not to produce things of beauty of create physical fruit but to create the fruit of the spirit [^3]

[^2]: [[Matt 28|Matt 28:19]]: This verse is Jesus giving out the great commission. **Note**: the great commission is back by Jesus having authority now over heaven and earth similar to how humans once did before the fall, we had authority under [[God]], but we gave that over.
[^3]: [[Gal 5|Gal 5:22-23]]: Here we see the fruit that the [[Holy Spirit]] produces in a Christians life. This is the greatest witness we can have.

# Applications
it is important for us as Christians to fulfill what we are called to. FYI you do have a calling. From some it is to teach others it is to give, still more it is to pray. We are all one body are we not [^4]. The thing is that we are called to live a life of unity with other Christians. This is hard, and honestly the first and hardest step is communication.

## For this Area
When i was talking with my church's music pastor about this group he mentioned that other musiic pastors had noticed and desire to see this problem of our city having most people "stove piped" into our churches. First of all our city is lucky to have a number of good churches, but the problem is especially for the YA (18-35) group we are spread out, and this may in fact be necessary.

Why do I think there may be a need for us to be spread out here. Well because each of us are called to the place we are rn, or we are being called to move and not listening (fyi don't do that, God will push ya hehe), but why well there are things for us to learn. Maybe its contentment, maybe its a specific skill that some 80 year old lady has at your church that no one could teach you except her. Honestly for that I don't know. 

This being said for this city I think there is also a unique need that most pastors would agree needs to be solved. We need to be the church outside the church building. This is a growing problem **especially** for the south. So how do we fix it. We stop talking and start doing, we start serving we start talking we start behaving in a manner that is Christ like outside the church. Furthermore we meet outside the normal building we put aside the "ownership" aspect of ministry and just be with each other. This is very important for the YA group here because many of us are not able to be with the rest of the cohort and tbh I honestly wasn't sure there were many of us in this city.


[^4]: :[[1 Cor 12|1 Cor 12:14-20]] - this passage covers how we are all one body of Christ and that we all have important functions.

This week we see an objectlesson on the uselessness of Israel.

## The Object Lessons
Our first section has two obejcts lessons using underwear (yes) and wine jars to show how useless Israel has become to God and how [^m1]. Now the first impression i had was to question why God use the undergarmet so to the commentaries and we find that this is a symbol of intimacy [^garner-howes], purity [^matthew-poole], and the covenant [^john-gill]. All of which have been ruined by Israel "prostituting" herself with other nations. The second object lesson follows in suit with the wine jars symbolizing how Judah should be filled with God [^enduring-word] this being filled with the wrong things is whwat results in destruction that flows throught the whole nation [^matthew-henry]

### Applications
- Do we live a life that maps to this?
    - If you are a Chritian you are under the New Covenant. You have htat type of relationship with God that Israel had. Have you thrown it out for the sake of sin? For the sake of your our success?
    - Are you filled with the Holy Spirit or are you filling yourself with sin? Is your mind quick to think of evil things to do?
## God's Correction
Our next section is similar to other areas of Jeremiah, God is going435 to judge Judah and is pleading with them to repent and change [^m2]. The biggest call here is to be humble and know who God is. Why? because otherwise we see the destruction God will bring. Within this God does call out the king and queen of Israel and the whole people lose what gives them pride. We see God shaming Israeal in the next section if you bible slipts like mine.

We also see a return to caling out the "lustful neighing" of Israel here at the end.

### Applications
Knowing that we are called to be changed (metomorphised) by the renewing of our mind do you htink that verse 23 applies to Christians? If so How?

Knowing that humility is the first step to really seeing change are there places you have put pride in that God is stimming the growth of.
# Next Week
We be hopping into Jeremiah 14.

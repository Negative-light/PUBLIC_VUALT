# Review
We have been in the book of Jeremiah for a while now. WE have been in the first section where we see the restoration of [[p-nation-of-israel|Israel]] after their exile to [[üèôÔ∏èBabylon|Babylon]]. This prophecy that [[God]] calls [[p-jeremiah|Jeremiah]] to write down to be carried into the exile as a reminder of God's promise that he would restore the nation.

# Lesson
Todays lesson we finish the first chapter of this section. Further expounding on the general idea that God will restore Israel and [[city-jerusalem|Jerusalem]]. Today we look at two sides as we do return to the idea of Judgment as well for a bit.

Some reminders is that this is written while Jerusalem is under siege and Jeremiah is apparently in jail [^garner-howes][^enduring-word]. This chapter and the next few are all written during a *very* dark time. God's response to seeing that is not to pack on the darkness. It is to highlight the light. To invert the natural human tendency.

## Full Restoration
The first portion of this section talks about how God would cause the restoration of all of the promised land. That their national wealth, their cities, population and leadership would be fully reestablished. The idea here i want to highlight is that they would "build upon the mound" of their history [^1].

This of course cannot ignore that all of the restoration of Israel mirrors the future restoration we have hope for through [[jesus|Christ]] when we get to [[Heaven]]. We can see all the bad right now and understand that when all is done and over we will be with Christ where all things are perfected, our hope, our joy. Our pain will be but a faint memory [^john-calvin][^john-gill].

Something interesting in my analysis is that this chapter covers that everyone will be restored. I read this section as a progression as going back to being slightly nomadic in nature to having fortresses and a palace (though some commentaries do use this to call to permanent home structures). But rather people were actually willingly nomadic. So God is saying he will restore *every* way to of life [^ellicott] [^matthew-henry].

We also see that God focuses initially on the physical spaces that the people held. This shows that the judgment on the people left scars on the land [^matthew-poole]. We see those scare as archeology today.

## Judgment's Is Understood in Foresight
Our section section God talks about the coming judgment or storm that represents God's wrath. We understand that God's judgment isn't ever turned back but we also see something I find important for us today. That you *can* and I would go as far as to say that we **will** understand the judgment of God in the future of our *current* life [^2].

We understand that God's judgment will last as long has it must for it to do what God wants us to learn [^enduring-word]

# Applications

## Remember that God has a Plan
This is an idea that I have been considering and facing every day. We need to know that God has a plan that seeks for the good of the believer [^3] [^matthew-poole]. 

I will be honest. I am struggling with this one and beg that y'all pray for me. I am tempted often to give into despair. So I am no teacher here, just a brother in Christ in need.

## The Relationship of the Believer and God
Something that I noticed in verse 22 is that we see a reversal of the usual statement of God's covenant with man of course this isn't the only instance of this [^1][^4][^5]. This is the idea of the [[Abrahamic Covenant]] and the [[Jewish Covenant]] given to [[üßëMoses|Moses]]. That the people will have a deep relationship with God and God has a deep relationship with them [^matthew-henry].

I think we miss the heart of this idea looking at it as only "ownership". But I think the better analogy is marriage. Now I am absolutely not a expert here, but marriage has this same type of relationship. She is my wife and I am her husband. We "own" each other but that really isn't the right word. I don't know what that right word is but that is the imagery i think God tries to invoke. And understand that is the relationship we have both individually *and* corporately with God as believers and the [[Church]].

## Redeem The Times
something that I have learned often the hard way is that we when we sin have impact on all things around us. Our homes, our churches, our cars. The physical space of Israel was judged by their sin. We as believers all called to invert that. We are called to redeem the time. 

Redeem your day so that you are fufilling life. Redeem your phsycal spaces. So on and so on. Understand that I am also failing in this space far more than I can express. But this called out to me and i pray it blesses you too.

## Worship Is a Sign of Restoration
So the Hebrew word used for thanksgiving is [[strongs-h8426|todah]] which is about thank offerings and worship. That is that restoration will naturally produce things like practical giving (a form of worship) and direct praise. Note that this word is a used sparingly in scripture it is a special kind of worship [^matthew-poole]. Which based on my analysis of these words is also all about open hands which i find interesting.

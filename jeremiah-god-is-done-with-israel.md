# Last Week
Last time we explore the phenomenal disobedience as we walk away from [God](God.md) using [Jeremiah](%F0%9F%A7%91Jeremiah.md) warn [Israel](p-nation-of-israel.md) of the coming judgment for the sake of repentance and spelling out the details of that judgment.
# This Week
This week we look at a second object lesson that God wants Jeremiah to give to the elders of Israel. This object lesson is to go and get a clay pot and take the leaders of Israel a valley just outside of [Jerusalem](city-jerusalem.md) and pronounce judgment on Israel for serving other gods such as [Baal](%F0%9F%AA%A8Baal.md) [^1]. Note that later Jeremiah will be breaking this pot but that will be explored in a bit. The location is important because this is where Jews would worship Baal and perform child sacrifices [^6].

The second section is continuation of the statement of judgment upon Israel and specifically Jerusalem [^2]. This is similar to other statements with the caveat that God does mention that the people would result to cannibalism due to how bad the siege was.

Finally we get to the use of that clay pot. God has Jeremiah smash the pot and use it to depict how he is going to destroy Israel and spread the people out such that the nation will never be whole [^3]. Mind that some tribes never returned from [Babylon](%F0%9F%8F%99%EF%B8%8FBabylon.md). We also see that the people were going to be buried in mass graves in the location Jeremiah was doing this at [^enduring-word].

The chapter ends with Jeremiah having accomplished what God had him do with the leaders and he goes to the [First Temple](First%20Temple.md) to continue preaching of the coming judgment because of the stubbornness of Israel's heart. [^4]


## Applications
I think that the clay jar is far more important than we think. Given that this is the second time God uses clay as an example specify to these people. The difference here is that God uses a finished pot that is then smashed. It is literally scattered or *dispersed*. Although Jeremiah was targeted at the [Southern Kingdom](Southern%20Kingdom.md), the [Northern Kingdom](Northern%20Kingdom.md) was also taken and this has lead to what we call the Jewish diaspora [^5] where there are now 10 "lost tribes". Note that we are not saying they came to the new world or some Mormon type logic on the matter. These people dispersed into the captor nations through intermarriage etc. The thing here is that as we know God is no longer seeking to have Israel Repent. Although he is still asking (why bring the leadership of Israel if not to do that) it is becoming faint and now changing to assured judgment.

A second application is just how dark the times of Israel were. In the first part God says that He "...never entertained the thought" of child sacrifice. This type of ritual is honestly the sign that the time of judgment comes soon. A nation must stray very far from God to get to this point [^matthew-henry] so much so that it is not even mentioned in the downfall of a nation in Romans 1 [^7]. We must seek God to change our hearts and the heart of our nation because even now we live in a world in which having children is disrespected. A people who do not reproduce will die.

Taking into full context of previous chapters I think this is important to compare that God desire to work with us before we have been "fired" understanding that God is sovereign and can still destroy us [^john-calvin].

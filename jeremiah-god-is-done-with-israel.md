# Last Week
Last time we explore the phenomenal disobedience as we walk away from [God](God.md) using [Jeremiah](%F0%9F%A7%91Jeremiah.md) warn [Israel](p-nation-of-israel.md) of the coming judgment for the sake of repentance and spelling out the details of that judgment.
# This Week
This week we look at a second object lesson that God wants Jeremiah to give to the elders of Israel. This object lesson is to go and get a clay pot and take the leaders of Israel a valley just outside of [Jerusalem](city-jerusalem.md) and pronounce judgment on Israel for serving other gods such as [Baal](%F0%9F%AA%A8Baal.md) [^1]. Note that later Jeremiah will be breaking this pot but that will be explored in a bit. 

The second section is continuation of the statement of judgment upon Israel and specifically Jerusalem [^2]. This is similar to other statements with the caveat that God does mention that the people would result to cannibalism due to how bad the siege was.

Finally we get to the use of that clay pot. God has Jeremiah smash the pot and use it to depict how he is going to destroy Israel and spread the people out such that the nation will never be whole [^3]. Mind that some tribes never returned from [Babylon](%F0%9F%8F%99%EF%B8%8FBabylon.md). 

The chapter ends with Jeremiah having accomplished what God had him do with the leaders and he goes to the [First Temple](First%20Temple.md) to continue preaching of the coming judgment because of the stubbornness of Israel's heart. [^4]


## Applications
I think that the clay jar is far more important than we think. Given that this is the second time God uses clay as an example specify to these people. The difference here is that God uses a finished pot that is then smashed. It is literally scattered or *dispersed*. Although Jeremiah was tageted at the [Southern Kingdom](Southern%20Kingdom.md), the [Northern Kingdom](Northern%20Kingdom.md) was also taken and this has lead to what we call the Jewish diaspora [^5]

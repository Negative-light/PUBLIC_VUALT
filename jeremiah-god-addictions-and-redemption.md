# Last Week
Last week we talks about how [God](God.md) had called [Jeremiah](p-jeremiah.md) to become a sign to the [Southern Kingdom](Southern%20Kingdom.md) because he is not going to get married nor partake in any celebrations. This is to make it clear that the judgment is coming.
Another side to this that we looked at was how God was sparring Jeremiah who would have also suffered some due to being married and joining in merriment while preaching of a great judgment coming.

# This Week
This week we are going to be hitting on another "fun" topic of addiction focusing on the idea that God opening the door for you to continue or go deeper in sin can in fact be a part of the punishment of sin. This hits home for me because I have dealt with that and it is not a fun space to be in.

## God Judges Israel
Our first segment here God gives Jeremiah a specific word to gives the people ask the "Why" question [^1] behind suffering. The Answer is that God has judged them because they have abandoned.

The problem in all of this is that the people are simply trying to use denial as a method to avoid the judgment [^matthew-henry] showing a hardness of heart [^john-calvin]

Here we hit the opening of this lesson. God describes to Jeremiah how the Israelites will worship "other gods" even more, **because** He will not show them grace. This is really that the sin has become the punishment for this sin itself.
Now if you haven't been in addiction I can tell you that that is what it feels like at some point [^matthew-henry]. Additionally the place God sends them is isolated [^john-gill].

## God Sends others To Israel

Ok we are gonna jump real fast to drill home the last point. Our next segment God calls out that he is sending both fishermen and hunters  because the Israelites have desecrated the land with idols [^2]


Something i found interesting with this section is the call that God is calling fishermen. Which later on [Jesus](%F0%9F%91%BCJesus.md) uses to call some of the disciples [^5] though this is probably in a more negative sense [^guzik]. Mind that this may not be literal either it was just something fun i noticed but there is disagreement in the commentaries ranging from there being no connection [^garner-howes] [^matthew-poole] [^ellicott] to the view that it is a redemptive connection (that is that Jesus is repurposing it in the NT) [^guzik].

## The Redemption Arc
So now we are gonna hope backwards and forwards analyzing. God isn't judging Israel just to be cruel he wants them to return to him so much so that even how others see Israel changes [^3] and we see in Jeremiah's call out to God the response that we should have when facing sin, judgment or persecution that God is our source of strength [^4]. Our God doesn't use judgment as a system just to knock you down the goal is to redeem you, to redeem us [^enduring-word].

Although God keeps his mercy back that is in fact with the goal to show his mercy and grace later on.

## Applications
Now there are several layers here and frankly while I write this I am not sure where God is taking this particular lesson so some of this is gonna be adlibbed. 
1. We know that god has called us to share the Gospel and honestly the truth is that this story isn't too different from everyone's. At one point we were dead in our sins trying to feel alive maybe in them but that was all fake. Meanwhile God has called us to a better life. When we tell the story of the Gospel understand that God gives us wisdom and applications on **how** to present that message.
2. We as Christians should understand the weight of discipline. Others see what is happening and it hurts. The sins we desire to keep hidden are not hidden, not really. We can tell when the Holy Spirit has backed away you have begun to grow a fruit that is sour and bitter rather than the sweetness of the fruit of the spirit. We as borhters and sisters in Christ are called to help eachother push away from sin and chase righteousness


Now we come to the homework I gave for this class. To watch a video that covers the experience of addiction and recovery [^6]. This video actually released today and happened to e the first thing on my YouTube feed, it felt applicable to create some level of empathy for those that are suffering from addiction. But also to create some understanding of what needs to happen to leave it. You must shirk the thoughts of your addiction *out* of the mind rather than focusing on it. Frankly it is hard to not focus on sin as a Christian. We want it *out* but i we are called to "flee it". When you flee you don't just run to some random spot you must "flee" to safety. That safety being Christ. We are called to focus on Christ and as we being living for him more and more the addiction loosing a grip on you and God embraces you.

You may think that God is asking us to kill sin. Which he is [^7] but the thing is that you are not fighting an enemy you can kill so easily. You must starve the desires of your flesh and sadly with addiction that can be a process [^8]. That process is walking in the Spirit living your life for Christ. Mind that yes we should flee sin early and often and do not use my words as a license to sin. YOU ARE WITHOUT EXCUSE. Sin no more yes, but much in life is neutral is it not far better to LIVE for CHRST? To belabor this one more time *we* must understand that being lukewarm is not living for sin, but simply **not living for Christ**. This is what makes one a whitewashed tomb.

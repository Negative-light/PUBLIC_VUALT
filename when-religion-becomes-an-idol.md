# Last Week
Last week we looked at how [God](God.md) was sifting [Israel](%F0%9F%8F%99%EF%B8%8F%F0%9F%8F%99%EF%B8%8FNation%20of%20Israel.md) callign them to mourn for the sins they had committed and followed. We also see [üßëJeremiah](%F0%9F%A7%91Jeremiah.md) becomes the "sifter" or blacksmith of the nation testing their actions.
# This Week
[^m1]: [Jer 7:1-10](Jer%207.md)

Today we see what happens when religion itself becomes an Idol like it did for the nation of Israel. Something interesting to consider is that Christianity thorugh we like to say is a "relationship not a religion" truthfully is a religion. This being said it is a religion based on a relationship with God. I am going to talk about toward the end what God desires out of us and this is a important consideration to pull in.
## Religion has Become an Idol
The first thing to see is the consequences of what I will be calling "vain religion".

### Trust In a Building Not a person
Our first section we see that Israel has focused on the habits of what God told the people to do. Sacrificing to God, and treating the temple as "safe" like little kids playing tag. Meanwhile we see that Israel was also evil mistreating those around them [^m1]

Specifically they
- Mistreat foreigners (ie RACISM)
- Mistreat the fatherless and widows
- shed innocent blood
- follow other Gods
- murder
- steal
- commit adultery
- break vows

Overall they use the temple to fuel a false sense of security, meanwhile God is calling for them to repent [^guzik]. This false sense in security (using God as a catchall) weakens the overall nation [^garner-howes]. The turth here is that they made religion a supersition [^john-gill]

#### Applications
Are there common supersitions that we as Chrisitans have about our faith?

#### An Aside
Something that sticks out to me here is that many Christians treat the church buildings as the temple of God, but we are God's temple [^b1] [^b2]. This results in many superstitions and a idolatry to a building covered in crosses. I do understand why we should respect our church building (it is our "common" building and it is disrespectful to damage something that we as a body collectively own), but it also seems like using God as an excuse for that could easily cause problems. 

[^b1]: [1 Cor 3:16](1%20Cor%203.md)
[^b2]: [2 Cor 6:16](2%20Cor%206.md)

### An Example of Judgment
Our next section we see God highlight that he is not going to treat a place of worship uniquely just becase it is a place of worship. Rather he will still bring judgment on it [^m2]. This is using [üèôÔ∏èShilo](%F0%9F%8F%99%EF%B8%8FShilo.md) the former location of the [üè†Tabernacle](%F0%9F%8F%A0Tabernacle.md) [^b3]. This section is a reminder that God will withdraw his presence (and thereby his blessing) if judgment is needed [^metthew-henry]. 

The focus is that religion had become an Idol for the nation of Israel. This naturally makes their actions "vain". This is something to consider that we even as Christians have "religious" actions, going to Church, studying the scriptures, prayer, communion etc. These actions though good (just as sacrifice was) is not what God wants. That is obidence from the heart
[^b3]: [Josh 18](Josh%2018.md)

### God Commands Jeremiah
The next bit Jeremiah is commanded to not pray for Israel anymore that they might be redeemed [^m3]. Something that multiple commentaries highlighted was the "queen of heaven" which was an assimilated piece of culture into Israel [^garner-howes]. This I personally think would be something related to having a "wife of God" character via syncretism (this is something i would like to research further). No matter the method this directly shows how far the people had wandered.
## What God Truly Desires
So God desires us to obey him [^m4]. This brings home the concept of the sacrifices being in vain. That problem is a huge one for Israel. Something important for we as Christians to remember is that we are not saved via our evidence (works) [^b4] rather it is via [Faith](../30-Spiritual/33-Resources/33.20-Words/33.21-English/Faith.md). Christian faith though will naturally create the desire to obey God in the fullness of what he has called us to do [^b5]. True faith will resist ritualism and when the heart is no longer in the action it is wise to "shake things up".

[^b4]: [Ephes 2:8-9](Ephes%202.md)
[^b5]: [James 1](James%201.md)


### The God of Paitence
The last section is God commanding Jeremiah to still reach out to Israel despite knowing their heart will not change [^m5]. God still wanted to change the hearts of the people (I would say for the sake of the few that would change) even if the end result wouldn't change. Do you not see the patience of our God. His never ending love.
# Next Week
Ok next week will be on Jeremiah 8.

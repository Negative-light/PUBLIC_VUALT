# Last Week
Last week we looked at a set of prophecies that [God](God.md) gave the kings of the [Southern Kingdom](Southern%20Kingdom.md). These covered the nature of their deaths and a charge to seek justice. 

The focus for us in looking at that is as the leaders in our life what does this mean for us. How can we seek justice and righteousness for God. But a second element is how can we redeem people's legacy, a better way to put this is how can we build on the legacy of those who came before us **including** the bad.

# This Week
This week [Jeremiah](../p-jeremiah.md) bring forward a charge against false leader but includes within it a prophecy on [Jesus](../30-Spiritual/33-Resources/33.10-People/jesus.md). 

## Woe Upon the bad Shepherds
This first section targets the shepherds (leaders) who refused to cover and take care of the people [^1]. The primary charge here is that they are not intentionally harming but rather were neglectful. Negligent in duty causing them to be scattered. But this ends with a promose to raise new leaders after the coming exisle.

Now I will say that these are probably the political rulers [^matthew-poole] [^ellicott] (though having recently read on the life of [King Solomon](%F0%9F%A7%91King%20Solomon.md) I would say that the kings were just as much spiritual) but this applies to the current leaders. Now the job of a shpherd is to bring together the people to live a life that glorifies God (and is abundant) [^garner-howes] but these leaders scatter the people. As far as history I will note that Eliicott theorizes this is addresing the theocracy formed under Ezra and Nehemiah [^ellicott]

Given that the charge here is scattering due to neglect how can this happen not just at church but in general?
## The Coming Branch
The next section cover the raising of a branch of [David](%F0%9F%A7%91David.md) a continuation on the [Davidic Covenant](Davidic%20Covenant.md). This includes a name for Christ (Yahweh-zidenu). This is supposed to be something so powerful that how God himself is described would change [^2]

Apparently there is an idea that this could talk of Zerubbabel but in general most commentaries greatly disagree even calling the idea preverse [^john-calvin]. Of course we also shouldn't miss that this also talks of a fully functional king and not a puppet king over a vassal state [^enduring-word]

## Applications

How do we handle the fact that this church could be charged with neglect?
    - Check-in with those under us
    - Gather feedback
        - PROVIDE THE FEEDBACK
    - Accountability
What is God calling you to do to lead in this body? How can you help undo the effects of neglect?

How can we feed the flock?

What does this tell us about how God can handle those over us? What is the application in association to the concept of church hurt?

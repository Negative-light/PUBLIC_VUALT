# Last Week
Last week we focused on the pain that comes from being a prophet through the eyes of [p-jeremiah](../p-jeremiah.md) who [God](God.md) also calls to repent for the sake of returning to him. This cam with a promise that God would establish him before [Israel](p-nation-of-israel.md)

Furthermore we discussed how to share the Gospel at work. How we should be doing those things that open doors such that other will listen to the Gospel.

# This Week
This week isn't a fun topic for us. We are hitting on marriage. Spicily singleness as in this chapter Jeremiah is called to be a "living sign" for the people [^matthew-henry]. So before we get started by hitting a key verse on the topic

## All Sides of Marriage are a blessing
Marriage and singleness are a blessing and something for the season in your life. During the time we are single we have opportunities to serve, grow and learn with less riding on us [^3]. Having a family is not easy work and everything must be in consideration.

An example I think is pertinent is that of the next pastor of this church. Something he must consider is the life of his wife and kids. Obviously if he is called he should obey, but that doesn't mean that the first thing he does isn't to fix some things in those areas.

Mind that God hints that we should also be careful of the climate we marry and have children in. Because although children are normally considered a blessing even Jesus mentions times where it is a "calamity" [^4]. 

Ultimately just as marriage is a blessing we must acknowledge that singleness is too and some are called to it for ever and other called for a season. The key is that we must be content with the place we are in. I stand by this that many many young men are not married because they merely want a wife and do not want to be husbands, this is why the church has been dying. Our focus should be on carrying the cross and prioritization the ministries God has for us, even if that doesn't include marriage,

## Jeremiah the Sign
The essence of this section is that Jeramiah is called to do a few things for the sake of being a sign and prioritizing his ministry [^1].  Something important to also consider is that Jeremiah is preaching "don't marry", "don't have kids" and so on. Because he all these things are to prepare for judgment. It would be easy to argue that Jeremiah is also being called to live what he preaches [^matthew-henry] [^enduring-word].


[^1]: [Jer 16:1-4](Jer%2016.md)


### On Marriage
The first bit of Jeremiah's calling was that he wasn't supposed to be married [^1]. I don't have to stress that being single was taboo in this time, heck it is kinda taboo today. A fun fact that stress this though his that Hebrew apparently doesn't have a word for "bachelor" [^enduring-word]. Having children and being married is a good thing, so **why** did God call Jeremiah to be single **despite** this being a good and standard expectation.

First marriage and kids would distract Jeremiah from the message he is called to deliver [^ellicott]. Having a family "pins you down" and limits what one can do. Jeremiah was preaching a message that wasn't liked and frankly was depressing, that is not a space to raise a family unless God calls you. An example of the opposite would be [[ðŸ§‘Hosea]] though honestly that is not a "perfect" example, his wife was a... unfaithful his children were literally symbols of judgment, that family wasn't healthy. So we see why.

The second element is that God is having mercy on Jeremiah. This ties into the first topic, but a loving husband and father doesn't desire judgment on his family, and it causes great pain to see it happen. Furthermore when disaster strikes that will cause further pain which God is sparing Jeremiah from [^matthew-poole] [^garner-howes].

Before you get married we have to understand we are called to carry our cross and often that may require *waiting* or *abstaining* from marriage [^enduring-word]. Both stages of ones life have a purpose and both have their pains, joys, limits, and lessons. So before you seek marriage we must ask some questions.

#### Applications
- Is the church you are in a place that you can see yourself raising a family in?
    - If not what can we do to make that change?
    - If so how are you ensuring the ecosystem you bring a family into remains healthy?
- Are you focused on getting a spouse or are you focused on chasing after God?

### On Life
Now a lot of people would leave it here but I think the next section is an extremely important thing to continue with. Jeremiah is now called to not celebrate because of the extreme judgment coming [^2].  We of course hit back on the topic of people not being properly buried and their bodies being disgraces [^john-gill]. The real truth here i s God is calling Jeremiah to not join in celebrations.

This is again Jeremiah living as a sign of the time he is in. He is called to live the life of a "weirdo". This is a painful life but is hinted with mercy too. It is hard to celebrate when you see dark times coming. It is almost if not completely impossible. This darkness seeing can pull you down when in a incongruent place. So not only is this call a continuation of Jeremiah being a sign but also mercy on the young Jeremiah.

#### Applications
- Given the day and time we are in are there celebrations that you should cut out?

## Why Now
So we have to question why God brought this to Jeremiah at this point. Wouldn't this be something God would give Jeremiah at the start of his ministry. Well at this point the kind of the [Southern Kingdom](Southern%20Kingdom.md) would be looking for others to support  (him being [ðŸ§‘Jehoiakim](%F0%9F%A7%91Jehoiakim.md)). Secondly and as we will hit on next week the judgments that  hadn't really hit yet were coming very very shortly at this point [^guzik].

## General Applications
God is going to call us to live differently. And sometimes that is small, sometimes that is large. We are not in a time where we are going ot vbe considered normal as Christians. Furthermore we must consider the image we present in the day to day life we live. Do you join in on celebrations at work? 

Last week we focused a ton on work but lets walk away from that. how do you cleebrate with those in your life that arn't at work or those that work with you but you spent time outside of work with?

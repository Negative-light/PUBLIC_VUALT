# Last Week
Last week we discussed the prophecy announcing the 70 year exile for the [[Southern Kingdom]]. [[God]] used this to allow the land to rest after a long over due need for it. Furthermore this was coming with the purpose. God wanted to bring the nation to redemption.

A second element of the lesson was that [[p-jeremiah|Jeremiah]] had served for 23 years with no real results (and next week we will being to see some of the actual persecution Jeremiah had faced). Yet he persevered.

This lesson I believe teach us as future leaders of our church three things
- *Patience*: sometimes  the changes we want to see 
- *The Problem of Evil*: That sometimes God allows evil to exist for the purpose of discipline for those he loves
- *Prepare for the Return*: That judgment for those that God loves is not always permanent rather there is a end goal and God wants us to return.

# This Week
This week we see imagery of [[God]]'s wrath against not only Judah but also the other nations around them. This would be a "forced intoxication" of the wrath of God.

## Scripture Explored
### The Call
First God calls Jeremiah to take the "cup of wine of his wrath". And describes that this would be like an incredibly alcoholic beverage including a reference to insanity it seems [^1]. Something that is easy to forget is that Jeremiah was not called to be the prophet to Judah but to the nations [^3]. The nature of this ministry was to uproot the bad and plant the good.

This imagery is something reused by God often such as ins [[Psalms/Ps 75|Ps 75]] and [[Isaiah/Isa 51|Isa 51]]. This idea of a "foaming cup" of wrath that would intoxicate nations in calamity [^enduring-word] [^ellicott]. The result from this drink although obviously just standard drunkenness, but it would also be the effects of a nation ravaged by war [^matthew-henry]. 

### The Judged
The next section Jeremiah lists out each nation that will be judged [^2]. An element behind why the judged includes many of these nations is that this would attack the confidence Judah had in their foreign alikeness [^john-calvin]. Obviously we know of their alliance with [[ðŸ“ŒEgypt|Egypt]] but some of these other nations were tied up into that alliance.

As we walk through this section we see that Judah is judged first. The nature of God's judgement is that he is quick to judge his people. Although this is often after a time of grace, we should know better and we should turn faster, but if we don't God will come upon us quickly [^matthew-poole].

I did want to go through the nations mentioned and give you an idea of them.

- Egypt: Defeated by [[ðŸ§‘Nebuchadnezzar|Nebuchadnezzar]] before Judah. A later Pharaoh would be killed by his people as well (this is prophesied later in Jeremiah too (in Jeremiah 40)) [^john-gill]
- The Mixed People: these were a group of people who were in Egypt but weren't Egyptian. This would include both immigrants seeking protection from the super power and mercenaries working for them [^ellicott]. Basically these people were likely wrapped up into Egypt's punishment.
- The Land of Uz: Near Edom these people would initially celebrate Judah's destruction [^5] [^8]. It is not clear when this nation is destroyed but by the time Judah returns This area was populated only with nomads and if my understanding of Israel is accurate today it is still that way today.
- The Philistines: Here we have a few of the major rules of the Philistines cities. Later prophecies of Jeremiah specify that Babylon would invade and finish them off [^6]. Before this these cities would also be attacked by Egypt. Archeology also shows that the destruction was rather though [^ellicott] [^john-gill].
- Edom, Moab and Ammon: These are listed together because they are all children of [[ðŸ§‘Esau|Esau]] and [[ðŸ§‘Lot|Lot]]. Similar to Uz these people were celebrating Israel's Destruction and would be severely judged later [^5].
- Tyre & Sidon: The norther neighbors of Israel. Their fate has additional prophecies in [[Isaiah/Isa 23|Isa 23]], [[Ezek 26]], [[Ezekiel/Ezek 27|Ezek 27]], and [[Ezek 28]]. These nation's allied with Babylon and were quickly betrayed and would be besieged for years . These ship faring cities included some islands close to Greece. [^matthew-poole] [^matthew-henry] [^john-gill]
- Dedan, Tema and Buz: Living in Arabia near Edom and into modern Saudi Arabia [^matthew-poole]. These were general tribes and would be subjugated.
- The Arabians and Mixed Peoples: This again is very remote people and a superset of the previous group.
- Zimri: Never mentioned else ware in scripture and possibly related to Abraham. Basically a minor tribe  near the red see who wouldn't escape[^matthew-poole] [^john-gill].
- Elam: These folks were east of Babylon. Apparently known as skilled mounted archers [^7] and later prophesied against  by Jeremiah [^8]. These people would actually have been fully taken over by Babylon soon, but would return to help in the death of Babylon as Persia [^ellicott].
- The Medes: The counterpart to Elam in the medo-persian empire. They would finish the cup of rath on Babylon [^matthew-henry]
- The Catchall: The last group is a catchall of all the people around Israel and Babylon. These would all be crushed and subjugated by Babylon [^john-gill] [^matthew-poole].
- Babylon: This last name is actually a name for Babylon who would be judged. They would be judged once serving their purpose. [^ellicott] [^matthew-poole]

### The Force
Our final section is that this wrath would be forced on them [^4]. There was no escape from it and that it would be foolish to do so because God was judging the nations already. The idea here is that the nations refusing to "drink" are doing is in vain given that God is judging those he loves then you whom are far from God would absolutely be punished [^garner-howes] [^john-gill] [^matthew-henry]. 


## Application
- Why does God judge his people first?

Looking back at this lesson it is a repeat of the second part of the other lesson. The nations would be judged even the one God would use as a tool for judgment.

Within this we see that the judgment of God still has hope within it. It may not be clear. When you read this passage you probably didn't think that this little prophecy had hope, yet it does. God does not desire for judgment to remain but for repentance to come.

1. Is there anything that you think God will remove from our body?
2. Are you a tool for God's judgment?
3. What is the hope we can have in this time of our church?

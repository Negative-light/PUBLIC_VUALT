This lesson plan is designed around the book "The Battle is the Lords" by Tony Evans.

# Introduction
The lessons are designed around various topics but we start with a short [[PUBLIC_VUALT/GABC SS-Intro to Spiritual Warfare|Introduction to Spiritual Warfare]], where we cover *who* we are fighting (Satan), *what* the battle is over (glory) and *how* the battle is won (Christ, who already won). We also take a short break from the book too discus [[PUBLIC_VUALT/GABC SS-Intro too World Views|Classes of Worldviews]]. Following this we jump [[PUBLIC_VUALT/GABC SS-Back to the Beginning|Back to the Beginning]] of the war and explore how Satan fell and what he was targeting, additionally this lesson covers Satan's punishment and what the Christian response too all of this information should begin. Finally we cover [[PUBLIC_VUALT/GABC SS-The Battle Field|The Battle Field]] of the mind and how Satan targets a Christian and how we should approach dealing with it.

# Angels and Demons
This unit has us going over [[GABC SS-The Utility and Purpose of Angels|The Utility and Purpose of Angels]] and we analyze the [[GABC SS-Operations of Angles|Operations of Angels]]. This leads us into coming to understand the [[GABC SS-The Character of Satan|The Character of Satan]],  and [[GABC SS-Strategies Satan Uses|his strategies]] and [[GABC SS-Intro to Demonology|his servants]]. We closed this section by asking [[GABC SS-Why is Satan still here|Why Satan is still here]]?

# Application
To apply all of this we started to understand [[GABC SS-Our Authority Under Christ|Our Authority Under Christ]] and how that authority is [[GABC SS-The Authorization Organization|Organized Under the church]].  We headed into understanding [[GABC SS-The Armor of God| the armor of God]] and we deep dived specifically into the [[GABC SS-Spear of Prayer|the power of prayer]].

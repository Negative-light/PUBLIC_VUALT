This lesson plan is designed around the book "The Battle is the Lords" by Tony Evans.

# Introduction
The lessons are designed around various topics but we start with a short [Introduction to Spiritual Warfare](PUBLIC_VUALT/GABC%20SS-Intro%20to%20Spiritual%20Warfare%7CIntroduction%20to%20Spiritual%20Warfare.md), where we cover *who* we are fighting (Satan), *what* the battle is over (glory) and *how* the battle is won (Christ, who already won). We also take a short break from the book too discus [Classes of Worldviews](PUBLIC_VUALT/GABC%20SS-Intro%20too%20World%20Views%7CClasses%20of%20Worldviews.md). Following this we jump [Back to the Beginning](PUBLIC_VUALT/GABC%20SS-Back%20to%20the%20Beginning%7CBack%20to%20the%20Beginning.md) of the war and explore how Satan fell and what he was targeting, additionally this lesson covers Satan's punishment and what the Christian response too all of this information should begin. Finally we cover [The Battle Field](PUBLIC_VUALT/GABC%20SS-The%20Battle%20Field%7CThe%20Battle%20Field.md) of the mind and how Satan targets a Christian and how we should approach dealing with it.

# Angels and Demons
This unit has us going over [The Utility and Purpose of Angels](GABC%20SS-The%20Utility%20and%20Purpose%20of%20Angels%7CThe%20Utility%20and%20Purpose%20of%20Angels.md) and we analyze the [Operations of Angels](GABC%20SS-Operations%20of%20Angles%7COperations%20of%20Angels.md). This leads us into coming to understand the [The Character of Satan](GABC%20SS-The%20Character%20of%20Satan%7CThe%20Character%20of%20Satan.md),  and [his strategies](GABC%20SS-Strategies%20Satan%20Uses%7Chis%20strategies.md) and [his servants](GABC%20SS-Intro%20to%20Demonology%7Chis%20servants.md). We closed this section by asking [Why Satan is still here](GABC%20SS-Why%20is%20Satan%20still%20here%7CWhy%20Satan%20is%20still%20here.md)?

# Application
To apply all of this we started to understand [Our Authority Under Christ](GABC%20SS-Our%20Authority%20Under%20Christ%7COur%20Authority%20Under%20Christ.md) and how that authority is [Organized Under the church](GABC%20SS-The%20Authorization%20Organization%7COrganized%20Under%20the%20church.md).  We headed into understanding [the armor of God](GABC%20SS-The%20Armor%20of%20God%7C%20the%20armor%20of%20God.md) and we deep dived specifically into the [the power of prayer](GABC%20SS-Spear%20of%20Prayer%7Cthe%20power%20of%20prayer.md).

We then talks about strongholds for [Individuals](../GABC%20SS-Personal%20Strongholds%7CIndividuals.md), [Families](GABC%20SS-Familia%20Strongholds%7CFamilies.md), [Churches](GABC%20SS-Eclesial%20Strongholds%7CChurches.md) and [Society](GABC%20SS-Socetial%20Strongholds.md).

# Review
We have been walking through Jeremiah, this study on the words of [p-jeremiah](../p-jeremiah.md) and how [God](God.md) is calling for the destruction of [Israel](%F0%9F%8F%99%EF%B8%8F%F0%9F%8F%99%EF%B8%8FNation%20of%20Israe.md). Last week we saw how God was seeking a single righteous person in Israel but couldn'

This week we see God call [üèôÔ∏èBabylon](%F0%9F%8F%99%EF%B8%8FBabylon.md) to being her assault building weapons of war. This also functions as a warning to Israel.

## The Call to Israel
Israel is called to run and protect from cover because God is going to destroy [üèôÔ∏èJerusalem](%F0%9F%8F%99%EF%B8%8FJerusalem.md) [^m1]. Here we see God use the shepherd/flock analogy for the armies that would surround Jerusalem [^john-gill].  Oddly this analogy also could be used as the church standing or charging against the "gates of hell" that we see [üßëPeter](%F0%9F%A7%91Peter.md) [^b1].

## The Call to Babylon

### Prepare for War
Next we see God tell Babylon to build weapon of war from the trees in the area [^m2]. This may be considered simple to us like a little age of empires game. But in truth what God is describing here is a eastern siege this siege started  by gathering lumber from near the targeted city and then using nearby earth and/or the lumbar you would build up a mound till you got to the level of the cities wall [^ellicott]. The problem that God sees through is not the siege but the evil within the city that the people "spew out" [^enduring-word]. This also contains a call to be corrected in verse 8, that warned is the Hebrew word [Strongs H3256](30-Spiritual/33-Resources/33.20-Words/33.23-Hebrew/Strongs%20H3256.md), which means to be corrected [^heb1].  So even here God desires for Israsel to be changed

#### Application
God desires to see us change despite the problems in our life. Despite our wickedness. If we begin the process and look to God for correction *He* is faithful and will correct us in our life boosting our growth. Although we take the first steps God will carry us across the finish line.


### Harvest Israel
The next segment we see God using a harvesting language on how Babylon should treat Israel, to "glean" them [^m3]. This further on also discussions how the people should be gathered and that people will not listen to God. A unique view  from the Garner-Howes commentary is that this section also contains the anger of not only God but of Jeremiah [^garner-howes]. This is supported by verse 11. Overall the people are refusing to listen to God, to obey him, to line their lives up with his Word.

#### Application
Are you refusing to listne to God? Is that causing Judgment to spwan within your life?

## Israel Is Evil
The last section for today is a section on the evils fo Isreal, they epople lie, cheat and steal. Their bussnesses use dishonest profit, even their spiritual leaders have made dishonest profit [^m4].

# Next Week
Next week we will try to finish Jeremiah 6.

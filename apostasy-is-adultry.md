# Review
We are in a study of the book of [Jeremiah](../30-Spiritual/BIBLE_CSB_MD/Jeremiah/Jeremiah%7CJeremiah.md).  And the life of [ðŸ§‘Jeremiah](%F0%9F%A7%91Jeremiah.md). We studied Jeremiah's call and how [[God]] encouraged him because he was fearful of the [[Nation of Israel]] due to his age. WE then discused the first prophecy that Jeremiah has for the nation of Isreal. That God was watching over the coming destruction of Israel and watches over his word to see it accomplished.

# This Week
This week we are looking at the first example of Jeremiah comparing the apostasy/idolatry of Israel with Adultery. The concept being that Isreal was loyal to God doing its best to follow and obey Him [^b1]

[^b1]: [Jer 2:1-3](Jer%202.md) - this is the opening of the first thing God has sent Jeremiah to say.

## A call to Self Reflection
The next piece of prophecy opens with a self reflective question for Israel. This is a call to have Israel compare God to their Idols. This is shortly followed with God reminding them all that He has done for them [^b2].

This is where honestly Israel messed up. Throughout the Old Testament there is a call to remember God and what he has done. From the Ebenezer stones at the Jorden river to all of the festivals that God commanded the people the goal was to force them to remember

[^b2]: [Jer 2:5-7](Jer%202.md) - this is God calling out Israel and asking them to reflect.

### Leaders Called Out
Something I think we shouldn't skip over is that God specifically calls out the priests and lawyers. If we were to map this on todays culture you might say the theologians and pastors. Have we let this happen? Do we often forget to look back at what God has done. Do we encourage our leaders to not just *seek* God but to also *remember* what he has done. [^b3]

[^b3]: [Jer 2:8](Jer%202.md) - here we see God directly call out the spiritual leadership of Israel 

## God's Judgment
Now we see God's Judgment because of the People not being loyal and forgetting what *He* has done. ASNd that is that he will charge them

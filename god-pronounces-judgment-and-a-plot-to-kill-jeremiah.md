# Last Week
Last week we looked at a request of [p-jeremiah](../p-jeremiah.md) for [God](God.md) to have judgment on both [Israel](../p-nation-of-israel.md) and those that are coming against that nation. Understanding this shows us how important it is for *us* to ask God for discipline so that we might become better believers

## God Call Israel to Remember
This second focus on God reviewing the history of Israel mentioning [üìåEgypt](%F0%9F%93%8CEgypt.md) as a refining place for the nation. This leads God into reminding them of the covenant they formed and the curse of disobedience (i.e. following other "gods") just as their ancestors did [^m1]. Here we see some important points to consider,

1. Israel's rebellion is Generational yet God has yet to have removed them completely showing God's faithfulness against Israel's unfaithfulness [^ellicott] [^john-gill]
2. Israel's decay spiritually leads to this continuous rebellion which God highlights as their stubborn nature to not repent [^guzik] [^matthew-poole]

### Applications
Here we have to ponder what we can learn form this little bit of scripture. The first is that we see God as a faithful God highlighted, second a "echo" of our stubbornness, and finally we see how God does use consequences to build us up. We all face sin in our day to day lives, but we should not use that as an excuse to stay in sin. God calls us to be transformed into a new creature founded on Christ [^b1].

[^b1]: [Rom 12:2](Rom%2012.md)

## God highlights their helplessness
This next section God highlights how helpless the people are based on their reliance to their idols. This leads into irreversible judgment that He commands Jeremiah to not pray for Israel [^m2]. A key verse to look at is verse 20. The God of Armies (showing Gods strength) and the nature of God as the refiner of the heart and mind of the people. Ultimately this prayer is Jeremiah showing faith in God as judge over his people, knowing that God is sovereign [^enduring-word].

### Applications
When considering this I wanted to look back at the start of this segment. Really in the life of a Christian the behavior we see Israel exhibiting is very common for us. We often turn to a *thing* to comfort us, this could be pornography or social media. What does this highlight in your life? Do you go to God when you are distressed? Do you focus on how God is working in you when you feel down in the dumps?

## The Plot to Kill Jeremiah
This last section is interesting as God gives special judgment on Jeremiah's home town [üèôÔ∏èAnathoth](%F0%9F%8F%99%EF%B8%8FAnathoth.md) [^m4]. This is something I feel Jesus thinks of when he goes to [üèôÔ∏èNazareth](%F0%9F%8F%99%EF%B8%8FNazareth.md). These people knowing Jeremiah wanted him dead and this results in an extra judgment for trying to "thwart" God's justdmgnet

### Applications
Do you try to fight when God has corrected you

# Last Week
Last week we
1. Planned out this next year we do have some adhoc plans in place 
2. Discused the persecution of [Jeremiah](p-jeremiah.md) from [[ðŸ§‘Pashhur son of Immer|Pashur]] who was the leading priest of the [[First Temple]]

# This Week
THis week we are going to go over Jeremiah's lament from this persecution directed toward [[God]]. 

I am going to try something different I want to give y'all a few minutes to read our scripture. So please take a few mintues and read Jeremiah 20:7-18

## A Time of Great Pain
The first section here Jeremiah states the pain he is facing to God [^1].
In this section I do think its important to highlight that Jeremiah considers that God has "persuaded" him into a mission that he was not willingly asking for and he (Jeremiah) was not aware of the full cost of it [^enduring-word] [^matthew-poole]. 

Jeremiah also mentions that he is mocked for the prophecy his is given which he tried to shove down but he had no choice to epak. This made a cycle that he was divided continuously [^matthew-henry] [^enduring-word]. Additionally we see that the people that should be supporting Jeremiah are backstabbing him which echoes [David](%F0%9F%A7%91David.md)[^matthew-poole] [^ellicott].

Ultimately this culminates in a desire to quit ministry (now ain't that relatable) because he has only gained reproach [^matthew-poole]. This is because it was appearing the ministry would not produce fruit and the pain cause by the position given.
## Hope is in God
Our second section Jeremiah acknowledges the faithfulness of God [^2]. This section Jeremiah looks back to God's promise from the first part of the book [^5]

I think the encouragement comes out of the idea that God destroys the legacy of the persecutors [^matthew-poole]. This applies to those within the church as well. The legalists, the heretics and the unfaithful.
## Absolute Despair
The final section Jeremiah shows his outright dispare cursing the day he was born. Whishing that his father faced the judgement facing the [[Southern Kingdom]] [^3].

I think this is where I want to make it clear. This type of dispair is human. Something that we are taught unintnetionally from growing up in church is that Biblical characters are paragons of Christianity. But they are humans. Real people with real feeling. Jeremiah was "just a dude". Our next pastor is just a dude. 

I think it is also important to "vent" to let out the dispair to others. Why else do we see it in scripture if not to learn [^garner-howes]. Note that this should be done with causion as the goal of dealing with grief is to open your heart to God so that he as the master surgion can fix it [^matthew-henry]

## Applications
I think that as our church walks through frankly the hardest point in our history right now. We are dying. There is no denying it. This church needs to heal some wounds and we need to speak up... i am just not sure how to get us there. Frankly I am writing this while talking with my brother of throwing in the towel on everything GABC. I am desponded as I write this and feel like revival will never come. That our church is going to continue the disconnect and because it requires both sides of the old and young to fix that I cannot fix it mostly due to the boomers boomering that things will never change.


We should be faithful to what God has called us to. But understand that pooring our heart out to God is not just something people do in scripture it is a command. god cares for us and lvoes us. Desires to change us. And if you are holding onto pain you must open the wounds to let God in and heal them.

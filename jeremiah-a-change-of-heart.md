# Last Week
Last week we looked at a object lesson [God](God.md) had for [Jeremiah](p-jeremiah.md) using a potter to show that God was shaping the [Southern Kingdom](Southern%20Kingdom.md) the way he wanted to. If they were unwilling then God would work then by destroying the "progress" that was seen to soften the clay of their heats such that they would be willing later.

This obviously applies to Christians as God does work this way with us. Building us up but if we are heart in our hearts God will soften us up. That is not always fun.
# This Week
Here we continue from where we were and are looking at mostly a plot to kill Jeremiah and comparing that to the previous plot and Jeremiah's reaction. But before we get there.

## Phenomenal  Disobedience
We start look at God beginning up the judgment that will come to Israel because they are Phenomenally disobedient to him. This includes comparison of expected behavior of natural events such as snow melting and flowing into the river etc. [^1] Mind that the rejection of a God was not a common thing in this day, consider it like not being somewhat Christian in early America even if you weren't you rejected Christianity or face judgment from the community around you (or death), the nations around Israel were devout to their "gods" this was an anomaly  [^matthew-henry] [^matthew-poole]. 

The fact is that the life of a Christian should produce a fruit that is something that makes the true blessings of God be a "normal" or nominal thing in our life. Do you study scripture? Do you go to church? Do you live your life abundantly?  These things shouldn't be something special for a Sunday they should be so normal in your life that it naturally flows out. The analogy of the waterflows from [Lebanon](Lebanon.md) ties this idea the life giving water coming from the mountains were a given, you would be a mad man to claim otherwise [^ellicott].

Here we see the consequence being abandonment of God has he "turns his back" [^enduring-word]. This is God giving Israel what they desire to be free of Him and have their "gods" [^john-calvin] but they have in fact lost much more than they realize. So much more God today will turn his back and remove his blessing if we have elected to no longer focus on him.

## Jeremiah's Change of Heart
The story that Jeremiah tells before this leads to the leadership desiring to kill Jeremiah and we see Jeremiah call for the persecution upon the nation because of this [^2]. Now the nature of this persecution was fit of a planned attack similar to what happened with [Jesus](../30-Spiritual/33-Resources/33.10-People/jesus.md) (and possibly the inspiration of it) [^matthew-henry]. According to the Enduring Word commentary this was likely a slander based attack used to discredit Jeremiah, to use a character assassination rather than a physical one [^enduring-word].

What caught my eye in preparation for this week was Jeremiah's plea to God that these people be judged. Now this felt like a change of heart thought Jeremiah has previously called for judgment [^3], and in previous attempt Jeremiah rather goes to God to complain about his persecution rather than agreeing with God on the judgment to come and asking for it come [^4].

I think this shows how Jeremiah has come closer to God and seen the heart of Israel more and more. He fully submits to God's will and follows what he is called to do.

## Applications
Being close to God should be a nominal thing in our life. Such that if someone were to hear "so and so abandoned the church" it would be the talk of the town. The person would be scoffed out of the room. Do we consider making OGd that important on our life.

# Next Week
We will actually return to the concept as God being the God who shapes us. The imagery of God as a master potter shaping us into a vessel of great use and great beauty.

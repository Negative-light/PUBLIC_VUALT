# Review
What have we covered
- That there is a Spiritual Worldview
    - What is the War over
- There are two worldview classes, Spiritual and Naturalistic
- The fall of Lucifer aka Satan
    - He wanted to take the glory of God for himself
    - He desires to ruin our lives and decrease God's Glory while he Can
    - Christ has victory over Satan and ultimately we have victory in **JESUS**.


# Today

## Utility

- They are made for the sake of Christ.
- This is because all things were made for Christ's sake according too [[../30-Spiritual/BIBLE_CSB_MD/Colossians/Col 1#16|Col 1:16]].
- They are designed for the worship of God [[../30-Spiritual/BIBLE_CSB_MD/Revelation/Rev 22#8|Rev 22:8-9]].
- Unlike us they are purely Spirit. [[../30-Spiritual/BIBLE_CSB_MD/Ephesians/Ephes 6|Ephes 6]], [[../30-Spiritual/BIBLE_CSB_MD/Hebrews/Heb 1#9|Heb 1:9]]
- They Execute God's Plans/Will [[../30-Spiritual/BIBLE_CSB_MD/Psalms/Ps 103#20|Ps 103:20]]
- They minister to us [[../30-Spiritual/BIBLE_CSB_MD/Hebrews/Heb 1#14|Heb 1:14]]. Father examples include them ministering to Elijah
    - There is also a hint from [[../30-Spiritual/BIBLE_CSB_MD/Acts/Acts 12#15|Acts 12:15]] that we have guardian angles
## Quantity
Lots of them: [[../30-Spiritual/BIBLE_CSB_MD/Daniel/Dan 7#10|Dan 7:10]]. 

## Ministry
- Angles are messengers, Its literally in the name [^1]
 - Protectors of the Church [[../30-Spiritual/BIBLE_CSB_MD/2 Kings/2 Kings 6#8-23|2 Kings 6:8-23]]
 - Reveal the provision of God [[../30-Spiritual/BIBLE_CSB_MD/Matthew/Matt 4#11|Matt 4:11]]
 - Execute God's Judgment (Consider the 4 Horsemen of the Apocalypse)
 - Guide the members of the church  [[../30-Spiritual/BIBLE_CSB_MD/Acts/Acts 10#3|Acts 10:3-8]]


# Take Aways

You should be in and around Christians who desire to be Supernatural in their activity not just practical.

## Cautions
Do not over spiritualize yourself, this is a belief known as [[Gnosticism]], which is a known heresy.
Angles are not to be worshiped, in all cases where they appears in the Bible and are worshiped they ask the people to stop

# Last Week
Last week we focused on the heart and how a corrupt heart is like a tree planted in the desert (specially the Sodom Apple) who's fruit is toxic and dangerous. The purpose of causse is that we should focus on Christ and what he has called us to become.

# This Week
This week is actually going to be a lot more discussion focused because the focus is our action. The section of Jeremiah we are covering [God](God.md)  is calling the [Southern Kingdom](Southern%20Kingdom.md) to be obedient to the covenants and obey the [Sabbath](Sabbath.md) which is one thing that visibly makes Israel Gods [^1].

## God's Call to Jeremiah
God calls [🧑 Jeremiah](p-jeremiah.md) to preach tis message at the gates of [🏙️Jerusalem](%F0%9F%8F%99%EF%B8%8FJerusalem.md). This message is a clear and concise call to follow the Sabbath rest rather than working on that day. This includes a promise of blessings and a true king. The threat comes at the end that Jerusalem would be destroyed (which is the final result when [🏙️Babylon](%F0%9F%8F%99%EF%B8%8FBabylon.md) invades). The gate that God has Jeremiah go to is the busiest  gate which remember that Gates also functioned as the courthouse/business center of a city [^enduring-word] [^matthew-henry]. 

## Why Was the Sabbath Important
So here we hit the prompt I gave before class.

>  Is it right for us to worship God on Sunday rather than Saturday given that the Sabbath was established for that day?

I am going to start here with a question rather than an answer. Why did [🧑Samson](%F0%9F%A7%91Samson.md) loose his strength? Was his hair really the reason or was it the last stray and the outward symbol of his unique calling?

The people no longer following the Sabbath is really just showing the sate of their heart was so spiritually decayed they were no longer going to even follow some of the basic laws. This basic law was the one thing that made Israel different from the other nations [^john-calvin].
# Next Week
Jeremiah 18

I think for the next study I should be preparing a week ahead that way I have some thoughts and ideas. It would also give me more time to prepare. There is nothing keeping me from preparing these studied beforehand.

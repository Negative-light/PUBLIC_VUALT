# Last Week
Last Week we looked at how [[üßëHananiah|Hananiah]] provided false prophecies to the people in [[city-jerusalem|Jerusalem]] and [[p-jeremiah|Jeremiah]] confronted him. This taught us on how to confront good sounding false gospels like the [[Prosperity Gospel]], by first acknowledging the good and hoping for the best, but understanding that [[God]]'s word doesn't always sound that good. We must respond as well with self control not getting into flame-wars over things and that ultimately compromising truth leads to punishment
# This Week

For this weeks study I will note that 5-6 sermons could be writen on this chapter with different lenses and disperate applications. I strongly advise y'all study this chapter a few times. It is very deep and worthwhile.

This week we see a letter sent from Jeremiah to the exiles in Babylon. This was send most likely via an official envoy and the two people who sent the letter could have been trusted friends of Jeremiah as well [^garner-howes] [^ellicott]. As far as why this letter would be allowed to be sent some commentators do think that [[üßëZedekiah|Zedekiah]] reviewed this letter and liked the general message to keep the peace and allow him to remain in power [^matthew-henry] [^john-calvin]. An additional theory would be that if these people were friends of Jeremiah he could have also snuck the letter. [^1]

This letter is pastoral and I think is the first "epistle" type writing we see in scripture and is dealing with the same types of problems. Individuals in the group are causing a problem that will harm the "church" and possibly get people killed [^enduring-word] [^ellicott].

## Do Life In Exile
The start of the letter is a chart to "thrive in exile". To get houses, lock in and work. Have families, make business, do great things that make you thrive and the Babylonians thrive [^2].

I think we think we are better than these people and that we are fine hearing something like this.... but are you? They didn't want to hear that "make yourself at home" they wanted to hear "you're coming back". Seek to make the place your at be the "promised land" is effectively what's being said [^enduring-word]. Understandings that their ultimate calling was to be in Jerusalem but that it would only happen later and thus they should do their best [^matthew-poole].

I provided a thinking question yesterday in my study announcement
> Are you where you believe God has called you to be?

So lets discus that for a moment.

## Avoid False Prophets
The next charge is to ignore the false prophets (next week we are gonna see their fate) [^3]. This seems like a really short simple thing but I think this is the thing we fall into. We don't want to turst God so we listen to all this self help stuff. This is why false teachers like Steven Furtik are so thriving. He is a good motivational speaker, he makes you feel good but in the end he isn't challenging you to be where God wants you.

Mind I am not going to pretend that I am not one to fall in this space either. You shouldn't trust me. Rather we are siblings in Christ. We should be discipling or doing life together. When one of us is loosing focus we should be holding each other walking forward.

These people tell you to just hold out or to push harder on something God may not want us to do **right now**. This also isn't to say to not look forward to Jerusalem to our calling. But that right now we must make sure to dedicate ourselves to him. TO be be faithful in a little.

## God Has A Plan
Hey we have another verse out of context here. This section is God saying that despite you being in exile, not obviously being on the "right path" he is working things out. [^4]

Truthfully this is something to consdier that they like us would think that God hates them as well. This is comforting. God has a plan and a desire for our salvation. We are a new creation, we are not some broken pot but a new creation in Christ... something that I needed a harsh reminder of from my own brother this week. God has you where you are so you have what you need to stand where he wants you sustanably [^matthew-henry] [^enduring-word]
## Applications

### Thrive In Exile
The first thing that stuck out like a sore thumb to me was in verse 4-7 where God calls the people to go on with everyday life. To have families and to even make [[üèôÔ∏èBabylon|Babylon]] thrive.

There are many directions we can take this:
- Do your best where God has you. That is really the explicit call here.
- Focus on where God has you. This comes form the second part where false prophets are telling the people God wants them in Jerusalem *now*. That isn't the case. This also didn't mean ignore the future, but that you need to be sustainable to get there to begin with

### Trust God's Plan
Another side of how God treats this is to inform the people that he has a plan. Rather to confirm that He has a plan for this. It just don't look clear to them. Obviously we can look at this and see how this helps bring about the long term plans of God, but they couldn't. Same with us. We can have all the ideas and thoughts but we cannot see what God wants right now **yet**.

### There is no Right Time
Something to consider when we think of "God wants me to do X but it isn't the right time". I think the middle of an exile is about the worst time to have a family. And we know God desires for us to have one. He wants us to Thrive in life. And for a time that is going to look hard.

### Leader Are Forged in Exile
Within the exile we need to note that leaders were formed that wouldn't have necessarily otherwise such as [[üßëDaniel|Daniel]]. Note only that but these are the times we are often called because we are able to "go and do" at a much higher rate than older folk. That doesn't mean we should ignore their advice either of course.

# Next Week
We are going to finish this chapter.

# Introduction
We started with a [Introduction to the Book of Jeremiah](Introduction%20to%20the%20Book%20of%20Jeremiah.md). As we looked the the first two visions given to [ðŸ§‘Jeremiah](%F0%9F%A7%91Jeremiah.md) we see how [God](God.md) is calling judgment upon the [Nation of Israel](Nation%20of%20Israel.md) we then did [How Sin leads to us being conquered](How%20Sin%20leads%20to%20us%20being%20conquered.md) ending that first chapter of Jeremiah.

We see Jeremiah's primary analogy next in [Apostasy is Adultry](apostasy-is-adultry.md). This opens us into a discussion on [God Opening Us to Judgment](god-opening-us-to-judgment.md)

# Review
- We are in a Spiritual War
- Our Enemy is Satan
- Satan desires to take Glory from God
- Satan uses a common series of Tactics too attack us
    - Bad Questions focusing on what [[God]] doesn't allow us to do
    - Twisting Truths in small incremental ways
    - Blatant Contradictions with the Truth
- We fight on various "Battle Fronts"
    - Individual
    - Family
    - Church
    - Society
- There are two "structures" that Satan builds
    - Mental Fortresses - used to make us "POWs" in this Spiritual battle. Symptoms are basically a addiction or difficult sin that one cannot shake
        - Defeated via prayer, Study, meditation, fasting, service and obedience
    - Partitions - a "wall" within the mind to split you between "holy" and "unholy" or being double-minded
        - defeated via "Thought Claiming" or bringing your thoughts under submission and giving them to Christ
    - All attacks from Satan are countered via
        - Seeking God for Wisdom
        - Getting closer to God
        - Getting the correct view of Sin

### Spiritual "Ladders"
Section exported to [[angles-operate-as-ministers-to-gods-promises]]
#### What this looks like Today
The method of seeing how "Jacobs Ladder" exists today is really just looking back at the scripture and acting out in faith. This can be looked further into Faith in God's Word and Faith in God's Son. The goal here is how to "Open Up Heaven" and have it impact your life. Remember as well that faith will naturally produce a work or a result in your life.
- Faith in God's word is how you "know" what to do. Note that this is part of coloring your worldview. It is our primary counter to temptation.. [^b8]
- Faith in God's son this is a visible clear faith in Christ, God isn't going to provide. Or in how the book puts it "If there is no public confession of Christ before the world there will be no private blessing from Christ in the world". This is to say one should not be ashamed of the Gospel of Christ. [^b9]


[^b8]: [[Matt 4|Matt 4:1-11]] - Jesus temptation and how he uses the scriptures to counter temptation
  [[2 Tim 3|2 Tim 3:16-17]] - This is part of the final call of Paul to Timothy beseeching him to study the scriptures because of its many uses
[^b9]: [[Rom 1|Romans 1:16]] - "For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth ; to the Jew first and also to the Greek"
    [[Matt 5|Matt 5:13-15]] - Jesus uses the example of believers being salt and light to the world. We should not try to hide that we are followers of Christ because that is counter to our calling as Christians.

##  The Invisible World
The goal of all these elements is for you to  can be summarized in [[Col 3|Col 3:1-2]] where we are called to set our eyes to the things above. Or to color or world view more on the Spiritual Realm rather than the physical realm.
# Take Aways
- We should not be *practical only* Christians (like Elisha's servant). [^b1]
    - The best way to change this is too seek out and be around Christians that want to be *supernatural* in their behavior
- Sometimes God's provision or healing is going to wait till **AFTER** you have completed a trial [^b3]
- Study God's word and have faith in it as being true as it is our primary counter. [^b7]
- Do not live in a manner that you are ashamed 
- Look at the world thought the view of the Spiritual World rather than just the physical world

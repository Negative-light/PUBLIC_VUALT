# Last Week
Ok last couple of Bible studies we have been talking about Christmas, the various traditional origins and how they do not  accurately associate with Paganism. Although there are problems with consumerism with Christmas the purpose to use it as a day of remembrance for Christ coming is still valid and useful.

This week we are going to see [üßëJeremiah](%F0%9F%A7%91Jeremiah.md) seeks judgment over [Israel](%F0%9F%8F%99%EF%B8%8F%F0%9F%8F%99%EF%B8%8FNation%20of%20Israel.md). 

## Israel being Exiled
This first passage [God](God.md) calls for the exile of Israel because of their idolatry and Jeremiah beginning a lament over not having a "home" [^m1]. The things is that even is thie warning God is still seeking for the people to repent but that it is overall a urgent request. Now I think it is important that we see God desires people to feel this judgment, why ... so they will call back to Him and seek repentant. 

Now of course we hop into Jeremiah's lament which starts with a call to a woe being on him for the suffering he must bear. It is funny to me that there are people that say that believers shouldn't need to suffer and that with enough faith shouldn't suffer but we see through out scripture people suffering, even in the NT with [üßëPaul](%F0%9F%A7%91Paul.md) [^b1],[^b2]. God provides suffering even to believers if it brings glory to him by opening the hearts of the people.

Of course here we also see the "shepherds" being stupid and not seeking God. Sadly these false prophets [^john-gill] are not anything new, nor have they faded away. Today false teachers have sadly sunk in as wolves in sheeps clothing and despite being warned we easily fall for them.

This section comes with a image of [üèôÔ∏èJerusalem](%F0%9F%8F%99%EF%B8%8FJerusalem.md) becoming a trash heap and desolated area, which becomes true. 

[^b1]: [Phil 4:13](Phil%204.md)
[^b2]: [2 Cor 12:7](2%20Cor%2012.md)

## Jeremiah's Request
Now this section i feel is well timed because we are in the first week of the year. Jeremiah brings up that we as people are guided by God [^m2] and this idea highlights the sovereignty of our God [^matthew-poole]. Now something I didn't process on my first reading is Jeremiah asks for judgment on *himself* first rather than. Why? well because God's judgment on those that love him is not the same as that for the wicked. God judges those who love Him (hopefully all of us here) very differently to those who don't, his judgment on us is a "refinement" or discipline process [^b3] and Jeremiah understood that [^enduring-word]. This is a behavior that we should emulate as Christians because we should *understand* that Christ in us will correct us, and I would believe that going along with discipline will make it run much smoother for us than otherwise [^guzik] [^john-gill].

But the other side of this is that Jeremiah does ask for swift judgment on the people who are destroying the nation. A nation that is built on God and designed by God to be the representative for him. Now I do believe that God judges a nation as a whole but sometimes that judgment is more of a natural set of consequences today rather than sending in an invasion force. For America that is the declining birth rate, the common moral decay etc. Now here we see the focus on the outside sources or external cultures corrupting the culture of Jacob. 

[^b3]: [Heb 12:5-6](Heb%2012.md)

## Applications
So I think we can take a moment and ponder what this passage has for us. And given that this is being made for the new year I wanted to go back to verse 23. We know that GOd is in control of our life but we also know that God mentions having a vision and planning is not something the Bible tells us to avoid. So what are we to do?

I think that having a vision or plan for ones life that is God centered is the hope. And being willing to let God change that vision over time.

# Next week
We hop into Jer 11 may go all the way through that one may  not. Please read it through the week and toss any questions you got my way.

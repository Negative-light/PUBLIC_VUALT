# Last Week
Last week we started by discussing a condemnation to the political leadership of the [Southern Kingdom](Southern%20Kingdom.md) and how they neglected their duty to seek both justice and righteousness. They are scattering the people in their actions rather than bringing them together.

This is followed by mentioning that the [Davidic Covenant](Davidic%20Covenant.md) will continue with a future branch (this being a reference to [Jesus](jesus.md)). This being a promise that God's name would change. This does provide some context as to how the [Pharisees](Pharisees.md) would think that the Messiah would be a conquering king.

This applied to use as to the current state of our church.
- Has there been neglect in our body?
    - What damage has it caused?
    - How can we stop the neglect from continuing?
    - How can we fix the problems caused by Neglect?
- Are you ignoring your calling in this body?
- How can you hold the leadership of this church accountable?

# This Week
SO this week we are just focused on the false prophets who are providing a view of prosperity for the people. 

## A misguided use of Power
The first omen that [God](God.md) gives is that these men are misusing their power to do ungodly things [^1]. This also includes converting the [First Temple](First%20Temple.md) as a site to follow various religious groups including worship of [Baal](%F0%9F%AA%A8Baal.md) alongside God [^garner-howes] these being directly mentioned in verse 11 [^enduring-word] and in other scriptures [^2] .

I want to note that there are interpretations on the specific emotion that Jeremiah is describing in verse 9. Some call it grief [^matthew-henry] [^john-gill] but I would also consider it a combination with primal rage. Something I learned recently is that depression in men can often manifest as anger which is interesting and totally not a callout on myself (hehe).

The usage of natural crying out is a common element of Jeremiah's prophecies [^ellicott] but the nature here of course implies that the blessings promised from the land had been removed by God due to the prophets sin [^matthew-poole].

### A Modern Example
This power also comes with sexual immorality. I think it is important to bring out some current events regarding Michael Tait the lead singer for the Newsboys who lead a double life and was hiding sexual misconduct. The Roy's Report published an investigation and this is why he stepped down earlier this year. This has all blown up the last week fyi [^3]. There is a lot to this story and I can provide articles if you would like.

Now This example just shows how power corrupts. And I will include a statement I provided on my sisters discord on the topic during a question.

> Christian Entertainment is just like your local church, just *way* less accountability and the industry is 90% bad. It honestly worse than the secular entertainment sector.

I have a whole rant on this topic because now Tait will be scrubbed as if he was never a Christian artist. If that is warned is a whole debate in itself. But the point for us today is that sexual attacks are a primary way that cultures collapse [^4]. It destroys the nature of ministry. The priests had fallen into that sin set.

We further have to understand that leaders in the church are held to a higher standard and their fall from grace is much greater [^john-calvin]. TBH part of me blames those around Tait. It is the people who follow a leader who should keep that leader accountable. How many great men of God would leave a greater legacy if we kept each other accountable.

## Destruction for the False Prophets
This next section God looks at the prophets both in [Samaria](%F0%9F%8F%99%EF%B8%8FSummaria.md) and in [Jerusalem](city-jerusalem.md) both of which have lead the people astray to false gods [^5]. I think Jerusalem is much worse as not only do they walk in evil, but they also give power to evil people. This is like the priest in a city where he is in the pocket of the robber barren. At this point God compares them to [Sodom](%F0%9F%8F%99%EF%B8%8FSodom.md) and [Gomorrah](%F0%9F%8F%99%EF%B8%8FGomorarah.md). God promises a slow and painful death to these people.

I will note that this greater condemnation probably comes from the fact they they were trying to "serve" two masters [^john-gill] which is well not really possible [^6]. This is where the wormwood comes as "equal" to what they did to the people [^matthew-henry] and of course poisoned water has a ton of symbolism behind it. Such as how water is life giving but when poisoned it is the opposite.


## Applications
Ok now we come to the application point. How does this apply to us as the leaders of the church now and into the future.

1. Focused on the emotions Jeremiah describes what do you think he feels? Was this of God?
    1. I believe that these emotions are a combination of depression (sourced from the loneliness and hopelessness of his station ), grief and rage. Indecently thing these are God given and righteous.
    2. When we look at having these emotions I think using them in a controlled manner is best. Mind that I am the last one to talk here as I am often overwhelmed by my emotions
2. How should we respond during different phases of someone falling into sexual sin as a church? Also if they are allowing **others** to sin under their watch?
    1. I believe first off requiring a time to take a break from ministry is a must. Bluntly the policy of this church I think is wrong in that basically they view that if you have committed any sexual sin you are a used up piece of scum that should be shunned.
    2. I also don't think that scrubbing someone's ministry away because of their sin is inherently wise. Yes we should evaluate their ministry closely and only keep the good. This being said, there should be a **ton** of scrutiny.
    3. I do think that if a pastor specifically if they are creating an opportunity to let others to sin depending on the depts should probably be removed from that church for a time. AND when they are brought back be kept a much tighter watch.
3. What is the role we have to keep not just the current church leadership accountable but each other?

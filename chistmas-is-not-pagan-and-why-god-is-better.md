Ok so this week is gonna be fun as we encounter a good bit of the argument of Christmas being Pagan. We are going to explore beyond that but I though we could dive into this specific passage and how it interacts with Christmas.

## Christmas Isn't Pagan
So to start there is a excellent resource from Inspiring Philosophy that goes through the history of Christmas and Yule and shows how they are not really related [^ip-christmas-is-not-pagan]. This first section talks about how people create empty idols [^m1]. The core concepts is that the people are making something by their own hand that is just a object it is not a god, it doesn't care, it cannot act in any way. Ok but how does this effect Christmas. Verse 3 is often used as an argument against Christmas trees. This is very much not the case as the passage directly talks about the creation of idols [^guzik] [^matthew-poole] [^enduring-word].

Now an interesting insight is that the "customs" of the people doesn't just talk about them making idols, but it is all about how they have created a life system that doesn't look to God [^matthew-poole].

### Applications
How does idol worship tie into how we interact with Christmas?
    - Often the consumerist mentality does make "stuff" an idol
    - The use of [Santa Clause](Santa%20Clause.md) can push us to see him as the key to Christmas rather than [Jesus](../30-Spiritual/33-Resources/33.10-People/%F0%9F%91%BCJesus.md)
    - Something important for us to consider is that we should live a life of faith. Do we celebrate/live/act out of that [^enduring-word] [^b1]

[^b1]: [Rom 14:23](Rom%2014.md)

## The Glory of God
The next section discuses how [God](God.md) is great and powerful [^m2]. We se a large use of Rhetorical questions calling us to think of the true God and contrast him with the false gods of the day. I think it important for us to remember to worship even when we are calling out the evil of the day. this results in a great comfort form knowing the God we serve [^matthew-henry].

### Applications
How does knowing that there is a God give you comfort?

## Judgment of the Idolaters
Now we see God give [ðŸ§‘Jeremiah](%F0%9F%A7%91Jeremiah.md) a clear message that the people who serve these idols because God is the true and first creator and fully of glory [^m3]. Apparently in Aramaic the first verse here may actually be a proverb [^guzik]. The focus here of course being that GOd is the one who created the stuff that these false gods are made of. Other key things I think to consider is in verse 14 where we see everyone being called foolish or stupid similar to verses that call out that all are unrighteous [^b2].

Something that is of interest to me is that God being the creator often speaks in poetry this interest is something that even other noticed. [[ðŸ§‘CS Lewis]] and [[ðŸ§‘JRR Tolkien]] both have in their books for Narnia and Middle Earth.

[^b2]: [Rom 3:23](Rom%203.md)

### Applications
Knowing that God is our creator what are ways that this applies to our life?
    - God has a plan for us
    - God made us to be with him
# Next Week
We are gonna keep trucking through Jeremiah.

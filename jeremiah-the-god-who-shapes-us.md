# Last Week
Last week we look at the [Sabbath](Sabbath.md) as a sign to the world what the people of Israel are God's people. This comes with a ultimatum to the [Southern Kingdom](Southern%20Kingdom.md) before they are conquered by [Babylon](%F0%9F%8F%99%EF%B8%8FBabylon.md).  But the application for us is that as a church we should be know for showing the [Fruit of the Spirit](Fruit%20of%20the%20Spirit.md) and our [love](love.md) for each other as Christians.

# This Week
This week we are starting into a set of analogies that [God](God.md) brings [Jeremiah](p-jeremiah.md) using a parable from a potter shaping clay. This has a lot of applications especially for our church in the time we are in. And honestly with some things that happened this week that i have been made aware of. Ironically I write this lesson while my heart is broken or I am "distraught" over these things.

## The Object
This chapter opens with God having Jeremiah go to a potters house and see him make a jar. This is a object in the lesson God is about to bring [^1]. There are several ways that clay can actually be "uncooperative". Something important to note. The potter started with one type of vessel and because of who the clay behaved he changed the type of vessel [^matthew-henry]. This change could be considered (given that this second vessel was probably smaller) is that though the vessel was meant for great honor, the clay was uncooperative and fought against the potter thus it was made for less honor [^garner-howes].

For us as we walk through life God will make us and remake us as a potter does a pot [^john-calvin]. This is far more common today and the first thing that comes to mind is the short videos today from a creator who will make a set of clay objects and place them on a board such that they all fall into a pile on the floor, then he will remake them to create a loop. We might think that those objects were "wasted" but were they. First the creator breaks down their process and they actually only make the same objects twice. Once to create the start of the video and the second to make the content. And this creator has a purpose behind what he is doing (though I couldn't find the video to specifically remember the mission behind their mindset). 

## The Lesson
Now the important part is the lesson part of the object lesson [^2]. The purpose is that God shapes Israel as he wills shifting and changing things as He sees fit. Now obviously God is going to break the nation because he needs to restart due to the "clay" of Israel being unrepentant. This is how God handles us. And he has that right because He created us [^matthew-poole]. Mind that God desires for us to live a life that produces great honor, and has a vision for who we are to become [^enduring-word].


Although God does bring about these sense that he is about to toss away the clay of Israel but we seem the inkling and a truth nugget of how God handles those who repent. He is faithful and provides a chance to return to the original glory with which the nation was once called [^ellicott]. The nation and people eventually give rise to [Jesus](../30-Spiritual/33-Resources/33.10-People/%F0%9F%91%BCJesus.md) and the redemptive work of the cross with which we celebrate soon enough [^5]. The purpose is not hidden and maybe was more obvious for the people of that time.
## Applications

### Living Life to See What God will Show you
Jeremiah lived in [Jerusalem](city-jerusalem.md) and he was the child of the high priest under  [Josiah](%F0%9F%A7%91Josiah.md). This was probably not something he hadn't seen hundreds of times. Making jars were uncommon and given that most storage, and bowls/pots and dishes were made from clay in that time Jeremiah had probably seen this. The thing is God called Jeremiah to see this thing to use the general revelation to show a truth that would end up in scripture. Now before I continue gonna give a **HUGE WARNING**, the Bible is closed there is no more specific revelation God is not writing scripture, if you see something in the world that reveals a thought on scripture you must *test it*! This does come with a thought I had though. God desires to teach us things and they can be from anything. You are sitting in a dungeon on base and your writing code and have a thought on the structure and nature of the scripture and how God builds us as believers. Or you see how the heart is deceitful while watching a video on virtual democracies [^3]. Obviously you must test against scripture but God calls us to listen to him continuously and see these lessons in life.

### God Shapes Us
the other side is how clay is used and how God shapes us. Now I am certain that there were potters who did "shows" but it was probably rare as showmanship requires "wasting" material, something that wasn't available during that time. But the nature of pottery as an art sticks to this day [^4]. Today we have potters who make art pieces to destroy them but they are used to make a statement or tell a story. The nature of the old is in the new and the new mealy is adapting to the world today. God doesn't make a Christian today like he did a Israelite 1000 years ago. The same hands act with a similar intent, to make a useful vase of great beauty, but how he forms us is different (and differs for each of us) for the sake of the time we are in and for the sake of the things we are made of. Either way God desires for us to be malleable and shift when it is time. This though beautiful in the end will seem bewildering and odd in the midst of the process.


### God is Not Done With you
An observation i had was that the potter did not fire the clay. This is the last step in making a clay object, this process is permanent and more akin to physical death. Traditionally we treat this as God breaking fired clay vessels. The clay may be dry but dried clay is still reclaimable [^6]. Dried clay is nearly impossible to deal with and probably was a symbol of a hardened heart if Jeremiah were to continue into this process and truthfully this is when and why God brings judgement, to bring in the plow to break up the heart [^enduring-word].

Something to add is that at times due to how clay was made there would be imperfections in the clay that would require a restart and continue work to unmarr this clay [^matthew-henry]. I think of this not as rebellion but as our past. We make mistakes our bodies are corrupt. But God doesn't define the us by the messed up person we are he defines us as the vessel he desires us to become. God sees your past and knows that there is work to be done. Are you willing to see God work in you to see those things done.

The process of potter is often times building the object and restarting. God is fine restarting with us. If it takes 100 times His love doesn't fail and his patience is eternal.

## Questions
Are you willing to "restart" with God? I know right now for me I feel this both in my life and in the life of my church. Everything is hard, changing and uncomfortable. Does this mean I have been disobedient? Maybe, maybe not. Is it a clear sign that God has a potter is working on me, yes. Is it comforting to know that God doesn't give up on me? *YES*, but it is not a reason to not obey.

The other thing is that working clay is a odd process and sometimes God is building you to something to bring you back down to build into something different. Clay sometimes must be stretched to be malleable to the extent that is needed. This is called coning, which is a process to aligned the center of the spinning wheel and it makes the clay more pliable [^7]

# Next Week
We are gonna kind of return to the basic theme before coming back here ironically.

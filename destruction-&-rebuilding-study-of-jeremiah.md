# Introduction
We started with a [Introduction to the Book of Jeremiah](Introduction%20to%20the%20Book%20of%20Jeremiah.md). As we looked the the first two visions given to [🧑Jeremiah](%F0%9F%A7%91Jeremiah.md) we see how [God](God.md) is calling judgment upon the [🏙️🏙️Nation of Israel](../🏙️🏙️Nation%20of%20Israel.md) we then did [How Sin leads to us being conquered](How%20Sin%20leads%20to%20us%20being%20conquered.md) ending that first chapter of Jeremiah.

This opens us into a discussion on [God Opening Us to Judgment](god-opening-us-to-judgment.md) and a further lesson on the [Rejection of God Creates Division from Him](rejection-of-god-creates-division-from-him.md).

We also see how [God is faithful in his love to us](god-being-faithful-despite-our-wandering.md). This love creates a [Repentance that Resists Destruction](repentance-resists-destruction.md). But we must know that when God judges it [can be a sudden judgment](judgement-comes-swiftly.md) but the goal is that it comes and effects our heart.

We futher analized [Jeremiah's First Lament](jeremiahs-first-lament.md). This leads us to Jeremiah [Looking for someone rightous](no-one-rightous-in-isreal.md). I have not come up with a Title for [god-warns-the-nations](god-warns-the-nations.md). We also see that God [Sifts Israel](../the-sifting-of-israel.md)

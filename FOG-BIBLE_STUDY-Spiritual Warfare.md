The goal of this Bible study is to explain the details from the book the Battle is the Lord by Ton y Evans about how to put on the armor of God.

This rolls down to the art or prayer.

> In your Christian life, you don't fight for victory, you fight from a position of victory.
\- Tony Evans "The Battle is the Lords" pg 238

A portion of our authority comes from the **local** church. when [[../30-Spiritual/33-Resources/33.10-People/ðŸ‘¼Jesus|ðŸ‘¼Jesus]] addressed [[ðŸ§‘Peter]] as the rock he wasn't talking of Peter but much rather the fact or acknowledgment that Jesus is the Christ. This is highlighted by the word Jesus uses *petra* which is a a fused set of smaller rocks that have been bound together similar to how we as Christians grow closer to each other through Bible study.

The nature of the church's authority is to attack the gates of hell. we are not on the defense here. Us not understanding this authority leads us to live in fear. We become weak spiritually and give over our ability to point to Christ.

The next part is your personal armament. Most of us are aware of the amor of God. This is a spiritual set of tools that God has given to you. It is not something you work for but God blesses you with. Our main objective is to **stand firm**.

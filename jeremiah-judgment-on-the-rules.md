# Last Week
Last week we looked at [Jeremiah](p-jeremiah.md)'s prophecy to the [Northern Kingdom](Northern%20Kingdom.md) that [Babylon](%F0%9F%8F%99%EF%B8%8FBabylon.md) was coming and that the judgment is set. 

We then took on to consider what this discuses for leadership, how we should take care of those under us. 

# This Week
So this week we look at the leadership of the nation specifically the kids of [Josiah](%F0%9F%A7%91Josiah.md). These being [Jehoahaz](%F0%9F%A7%91jehoahaz.md), [Jehoiakim](%F0%9F%A7%91Jehoiakim.md), and Jehoiakim's son [Coniah](%F0%9F%A7%91Coniah.md). Something that is important is that Jeremiah was especially told to go into the thrown room (well palace but I am going to hope this assumption is safe) and tell the king.

## To The Crown
The first section God is talking generally to the crown of Israel [^1]. 
We see again the problem of Justice appear here. 
In the zone of leadership don't ya think that is important to God. Yes this addresses the Government but that includes stuff in the church. If we as leaders in our church (independent of if you stay at this church) are to bring glory to God then should not justice and righteousness be priorities in our life?
I think so.

Of course these people (not just the kings but their officers). [God](God.md) marks them for destruction because they won't seek justice and righteousness.



### Applications
As leaders we should avoid the failings of these kingdoms. How can we in our church address justice, righteousness and caring for the vulnerable?
    - What do you think is included in the vulnerable?
        - *Personal Answer*: I think we often limit the term vulnerable to just the economic area. This is not to say that the poor are not vulnerable, they are and that cannot nor should not be denied. But what about those that are emotionally vulnerable due to past traumas. those that are mentally vulnerable due to unique problems in their life. To the spiritually vulnerable, the ones deceived by bad teachings both in this church and abroad. I don't think everyone can care for all the vulnerable in their life. I don't think every church can help with every case. But I do think we can cover as much as possible. I will say that my church cannot take care of those who have been through or deal with divorce, that is very apparent. 

## To the Children of David
The remaining portion of the chapter God directly addresses the specific people [^2]. There is a few importnat elements here to mention. These kings were actually vasals of Egypt after Josaih was killed by them. But Zedekiah was a vassal of Babylon [^enduring-word].

### For Shallum
The first son addressed is Shallum also known as JEHOAHAZ who was killed by the Pharaoh and was taken to [Egypt](%F0%9F%93%8CEgypt.md) . This is intesrestin because he also was setup as the leader by Egypt but only ran things for ~3 months [^garner-howes]. Something to note is that Shallum was the first successor to the thrown despite being Josiah's fourth child [^3]. It is also to consider why God had Jeremiah use this kings given name rather than kingly name, I would surmise this could also be in relation to the names meanings the kingly meaning that God would sustain while the original means retribution [^ellicott].

### For Jehoiakim
Jehoakim is is then brought out as being a unrighteousness king. Spicily this contrasts him with his father [^enduring-word].

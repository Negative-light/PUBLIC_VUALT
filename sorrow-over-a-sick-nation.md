# Last Week
Last week we looked at how [God](God.md) woulld destory the leadership of Israel and their legacy utterly shaming them. We further looked at how the people pretended to be wise without God and that that futher applied judgment upon them.

Today we see that [Israel](../p-nation-of-israel.md) is very much aware of their sin and know some of what they should do. This leads into [p-jeremiah](../p-jeremiah.md) lamenting
## The People Know and Will be Judged
This section shows Israel knows what they are doing. Seeking security in cities and knowing what God is doing [^m1]. We even see a callback to when God sent the fiery serpents [^b1] the concept of serpents as a form of judgment is a deep symbology [^guzik]. Despite this the people are very focused on a false hope that will not come [^matthew-henry]. Personally this intention sin I think made judgment worse and I think this is why after this we see God bring in serpents after removing the blessing of clean water (this is also symbolic I beleve)


[^b1]: [Num 21](Num%2021.md)

### Applications
How do you behave in regards to known sin? Do you try to just "hide away" hoping judgment will not come or do you repent?

## A Lament
This section is Jeremiah's lament of Israel's apprent foolishness including a rehtoical statement on if there is balm why hasn't healing started [^m2]. Jeremiah's sorry is considered by some to be a reflection of God's greif [^enduring-word]. But this even ties to our lives as Christians. Christ can be considered the balm [^john-gill] and he can be the source of all oru healing. Yet we as a people (either a church or nation) refuse this healing.

### Applications
Have you refused Christ's healing?
Why is it important to feel brokeness ofver the brokeness of others?

# Next Week
We are gonna start on Jermiah 9.

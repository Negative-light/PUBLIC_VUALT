# Review
So far we have covered that we are in a spiritual war for glory and that our victory can be found in Jesus. This war  effects us as individuals, families, churches and as a society. We have talks about how God helps us through angels as well as how to bring those angels into our life. In this war our enemy is organized out and planned.

# Today
## Short and Simple
Satan's primary method is deception, we see this in the creation of the world [^b1a] and in the formation of false teachers [^b1b]. This flows into those that follow him and teach for him. That includes but is not limited to false teacher, persecutors and ultimately the Antichrist [^note1a]. Satan hasn't changed form the begging and still devices us in the same way [^b1c].


[^b1a]: [[Gen 3]] - This chapter has the fall of man and we see Satan for the first time. What does he do, he creates a deception.
[^b1b]: [[2 Cor 11|2 Cor 11:14-15]] - This passage talks about how Satan will go as far as looking like a angel of light (or someone good)
[^note1a]: **note**: The Book describes the Antichrist as the "crowning achievement" of Satan. :It is interesting but eh
[^b1c]: [[2 Cor 11|2 Cor 11:13]] - This verse Paul expresses concern about the people being deceived like Eve was.

## Satan's Counterfeits

Satan provides is with a number of counterfeits today we will explore some of those.

### View of Authority
Satan wants us to think *he* is in control or at least that we can control our own destiny. For Christians this is very dangerous as we are called to be steward of God's creation [^b2a1]. The goal here is to take that glory of God and assume it to be our this usually doesn't end well especially for Christians.

[^b2a1]: [[Gen 1|Gen 1:28]] This verse is Gods "Prime Directive" for humanity that is to be fruitful, and to rule the earth as his managers of the earth. This is where we get the doctrine of Christian Stewardship. ~ *Authors Note* there are more scriptures on this and probably need to be expanded on.

### View of Right and Wrong
One way Satan counterfeits God is a corrupted view of Right and wrong. We see this today with a huge number of falls beliefs including but not limited to Universalism, relativism, subjectivism, existentialism, rationalism, phenomenalism [^note2b2]. This is backed by the idea that there are no consequences for your actions of that God is not truthful in his consequences.

[^note2b2]: These should be defined in the worldviews lesson.

### View of Christianity
Satan often corrupts Christianity. Today it is common to see the belief that "I am a Christian because I Go to Church". This includes prosperity Gospel and many other false teachings. [^b2c1]

> [!NOTE]
> That here we do use Christian to mean one who believes in Jesus and correct doctrine. The use of this word to mean this is waning in English thus this may need to be changed

[^b2c1]: [[2 Cor 11|2 Cor 11:13-14]] - This passage describe  people who are "false apostles" of false teachers.

## The Deception Process

There is a process to deception that is described in [[James 1|James 1:13-15]]. Sin starts as a desire but this doesn't mean the desire is not bad. The specific desire here is to fill a need in a bad way. Consider stealing food, there are two desires here the first is hunger which is neutral the second is to steal there may be motivations behind it (such as poverty) but this desire is not right. The later desire is the one that Satan will use and frequently will "sweaten" the deception with the good desire. Once we are tempted we are lured away by a deception, this deception could take many forms often being a planted thought. Finally Satan gets us to disobey ending in death.

## Why
Now lets take a look back at why does Satan want to do this specifically, not just to take glory from [[God]] rather there must be more here. Foremost Satan wants to disrupt the process of someone coming to know Christ [^b41]. Once you become a believer Satan wants to prevent you from impacting to world for the sake of Christ. Finally Satan is trying to prevent God's will in our lives.

[^b41]: [[2 Cor 4|2 Cor 4:3-4]] - this passage describes how Satan blinds unbelievers so that they cannot understand the [[../Gospel|Gospel]]

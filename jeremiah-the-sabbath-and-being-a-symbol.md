# Last Week
Last week we focused on the heart and how a corrupt heart is like a tree planted in the desert (specially the Sodom Apple) who's fruit is toxic and dangerous. The purpose of causse is that we should focus on Christ and what he has called us to become.

# This Week
This week is actually going to be a lot more discussion focused because the focus is our action. The section of Jeremiah we are covering [God](God.md)  is calling the [Southern Kingdom](Southern%20Kingdom.md) to be obedient to the covenants and obey the [Sabbath](Sabbath.md) which is one thing that visibly makes Israel Gods [^1].

## God's Call to Jeremiah
God calls [🧑 Jeremiah](p-jeremiah.md) to preach tis message at the gates of [city-jerusalem](../city-jerusalem.md). This message is a clear and concise call to follow the Sabbath rest rather than working on that day. This includes a promise of blessings and a true king. The threat comes at the end that Jerusalem would be destroyed (which is the final result when [🏙️Babylon](%F0%9F%8F%99%EF%B8%8FBabylon.md) invades). The gate that God has Jeremiah go to is the busiest  gate which remember that Gates also functioned as the courthouse/business center of a city [^enduring-word] [^matthew-henry]. 

## Why Was the Sabbath Important
So here we hit the prompt I gave before class.

>  Is it right for us to worship God on Sunday rather than Saturday given that the Sabbath was established for that day?

I am going to start here with a question rather than an answer. Why did [🧑Samson](%F0%9F%A7%91Samson.md) loose his strength? Was his hair really the reason or was it the last stray and the outward symbol of his unique calling?

The people no longer following the Sabbath is really just showing the sate of their heart was so spiritually decayed they were no longer going to even follow some of the basic laws. This basic law was the one thing that made Israel different from the other nations [^john-calvin]. It is intended to be a continuous reminder of the mission that Israel has to share the Good News they were given (a coming savior).

So what do y'all think about  the Sabbath?

## God's Test
Given our discussion this is a second perspective. God is using frankly the easiest rule He gave the nation as a testing point  [^enduring-word]. This was as sign of the ending point, and from here this section starts to become less of a call to repent and more and more about judgment. Note that we transfer to a new section of Jeremiah in chapter 24.  

## The Blessing from Obedience
There is a point to obedience here. The continuation of the rule of the line of [🧑David](%F0%9F%A7%91David.md) [^garner-howes], becoming a blessing to the surrounding area [^enduring-word] and general prosperity internally [^matthew-henry].  Apparently this is something called a prophecy of doom [^garner-howes] and these promises are common element usually spelling out the final opportunity people have.

## Applications
As Christians we have similar "testing points" I think. There are symbols that we should be upholding in our life to show that we are a Christian. This starts with some easy ones like participating in a Christian community. But I also feel that this applies to other elements that are given to us via the [Holy Spirit](Holy%20Spirit.md). Primary that we show the [Fruit of the Spirit](Fruit%20of%20the%20Spirit.md) especially the taste element of joy [^3]. Are you loving and show real genuine care for people (as the Bible says we will be known by our love [^2]). There is a lot here and I want to give time to discus so I have fewer notes but I believe it is important, if the church, if you, are not known for the care you have are you approaching the world God calls you to. Are you like Israel ready for capture.

The reality is that I think there is a version of this test that is applicable and this comes form Matthew Poole, are you willing to just spend some time with God, to set that time as separate in your life [^matthew-poole].
# Next Week
Jeremiah 18

I think for the next study I should be preparing a week ahead that way I have some thoughts and ideas. It would also give me more time to prepare. There is nothing keeping me from preparing these studied beforehand.

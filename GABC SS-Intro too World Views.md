# Review
Last week we had a short introduction into spiritual warfare. The major things we covered are
- Our Enemy Satan
- The Goal of the Battle being Glory.
- Our Equipment being the [[Armor of God]]
- 

# Today
Our focus today is on the two classes of world views

## Naturalistic Worldview
This is the view that there is only the natural world. More of a it is only real if it is observable through the physical sense.

The results of this are things like [[agnosticism]], [[atheism]] and on the extreme [[anti-theism]]

![[30-Spiritual/BIBLE_CSB_MD/Romans/Rom 1#22|Romans 1:23-25]]


## Spiritual Worldview
This is the view that there is a spiritual realm beyond the physical world. It is not necessarily Biblical, consider the [[New Age Movement]].



## The Implications of Spiritual Warfare
First we must acknowledge a basis of Spiritual Warfare.

Your worldview shapes all of your decision making and thus it has massive implications. Therefore we are commanded in several areas of things we need too do to different ourselves in the battle for the mind.

[[30-Spiritual/BIBLE_CSB_MD/Romans/Rom 12#2|Romans 12:2]] tells us how to be transformed by the [[Holy Spirit]] through the renewing or remaking of the mind. That word renew is [[Strongs G342]], which at it not only a complete embodied change but also a change for the better [^1]

I like this quote from the book

> The reason there are so many causalities among believers in spiritual warfare is that we have lost sight of the fact that we are in a perpetual state of warfare which demands constant alertness.
 \- Tony Evans *The Battle is the Lords* pg 36

Now we need to counter the other worldviews and that is why we need the [[../Church|Church]] too teach us and lead us in a manner that is important and/or possible. [[]]

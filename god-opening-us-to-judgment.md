# Review
This week we continue our study of the life of [[üßëJeremiah]]. This study highlights how idolatry and adultery are inherently tied together. How God is watching the destruction of Israel ensuring that HIS word is kept true.
# This Week
This week we see that God is releasing the [[../üèôÔ∏èüèôÔ∏èNation of Israel]] into their own sinfulness and calling out how racid their sin has become

## You are already Punished
The first section here is talking about where Israel is *currently* in.  This is all related to the Northern Kingdom. [^cite1] First they are already enslaved by [[üìåAssyria]]  they were enslaved by them. And they ere were even areas that were known for their cowardice that were over them [^cite2].  This was a caution to not loot to [[üìåEgypt]] or Assyria for help. Ironically this ties back to the broken cisterns from the previous lesson, God is calling Israel to not take the dirty river water of the other nations rather than seeking the living water of God. We then see God highlight how he freed Israel and they become nothing, he planted them and bless them and they became corrupt and evil[^b1]

[^cite1]: [Enduring Word Bible Commentary Jeremiah Chapter 2](https://enduringword.com/bible-commentary/jeremiah-2/) - this is one commentary that I used to create this lesson
[^cite2]: [Commentary on Jeremiah 2 by Matthew Henry](https://www.blueletterbible.org/Comm/mhc/Jer/Jer_002.cfm) - secondary commentary form Blue Letter Bible
[^b1]: [Jer 2:14-21](Jer%202.md) - this is the first stanza of our lesson which contains warnings from the northern kingdom


## You Cannot Be Cleaned
The next segment highlights that Israel has walked away from God to the point that they cannot be cleaned. This furthers the idea that apostasy is adultery. Starting with the idea that they cannot be washed no matter how hard they try or what products they use. Further GOd calls the nations bluf. They try to act like they are behaving appriatly but they are living a double life where they are going out to sin. They act like a donkey in heat, which based on my understanding is vary hard to hide its really clear. This would be the equvalent of God say *"I found you on Tinder"* today. [^b2]

[^b2]: [Jer 2:22-24](Jer%202.md)

The next verse i think is interesting it kinda describes Israel as an addicts. This behaivor is something I have been described by addicts especially to drugs where you feel life is hopeless with out "the thing", so yo may as well use it rather than return to God. [^b3]

[^b3]: [Jer 2:25](Jer%202.md)

We follow onto God further calling out the people. Calling them to be shamed, but here we see he double calls out the leadership of the nation. And telling them to return to their "gods" because he has disowned them.

## Why
Why and what is important here wwhat are the impacts on our daily lives form this passage. I think the bigest and most clear thing is that God will open us to the punishment of our sins. He will allow us to go so far that our lives are forever ruined by it, IF we choose to do that. I can say from my personal life that God is gracious in this and will hold you back at times slow you donw and if you listen will help you return *quickly*.

Today we have an epidemic of Christians living in sin. And these sins all have permanent consequences. From drugs that damage you body to phonography that warps the mind to the point where I would say most of our young men need to be placed into therapy over it. The world today is out to kill Christians to demolish our testimony.

One other side is that sometimes we have opportunities to help people who are in this state and we **need** to approach these things with care yes, but there is so much that can and will be done if we are faithful to Christ.

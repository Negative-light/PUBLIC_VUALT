# Review
Last week we highlighted how [God](God.md) called [üèôÔ∏èBabylon](%F0%9F%8F%99%EF%B8%8FBabylon.md) to destroy [Israel](../%F0%9F%8F%99%EF%B8%8F%F0%9F%8F%99%EF%B8%8FNation%20of%20Israel.md). Why? Israel was refusing to listen to correction. The good thing is that we know our God is gracious and will help us in the process of repentance. 

# This Week
[^m1]: [Jer 6:16-21](Jer%206.md)
[^b1]: [Matt 12:2-8](Matt%2012.md)
[^b2]: [Matt 11:27-30](Matt%2011.md)
[^b3]: [Rom 1:26-31](Rom%201.md)

In our fist section we see God warns the nations and that even sacrifice is not sufficient [^m1]. 

## Rejecting the Rest and Wisdom of God
This starts with a call for Israel to look at "ancient paths" that if taken will result in rest. This is rejected by Israel. The call here really is to return to Godly wisdom [^enduring-word].


Looking into the New Testament [Jesus](../30-Spiritual/33-Resources/33.10-People/%F0%9F%91%BCJesus.md) is described as the source of our rest and the Lord of the Sabbath [^b1]. Furthermore Jesus offers us rest for our souls [^b2]. Israel highlights how we by our sinful nature will not accept the true rest of God, desiring to attach to ritualistic rest rather than the continual refreshing that is offered from Christ.
### Application
- Have you rejected rest from God? 
- Are there places you have rejected the "ancient path" of God?

## God Doesn't Delight in Empty Rituals
We can further look at some of the warnings God gives to see some additions to what exactly is wrong. Here we see that Israel is giving sacrifices (v20) but they are useless before God. We see a theme that was mentioned before that Israel is walking through what God says without really believing it, this may have been a method of self Justification [^guzik]. We see this today in our churches varying from Catholics who have large bounds of traditions, to 7th Day Adventists who insist on "the true Sabbath", to Baptists who insist on little to no full tradition. Why? This is a problem of the heart. We see in the New Testament that all of the commands of Israel were there to highlight problems of the heart. 

The ultimate level of this is that if our heart is not aligned with what we are doing we are hypocrites [^matthew-henry]. The lack of a true heart leads to spiritual decline within the populace which leads to destruction [^garner-howes]. If we are then to look at Isreal and make these claims should we not look at ourselves? Of course we should, remember that the downfall of a nation starts with God giving us to our own desires [^b3]

### Applications
- Do you live your Christian walk in "vain reptations"?
- Is your heart aligned with what you are doing?
- How has your actions of not obeying from the heart lead effected those around you?

### God Lets Israel Fail
Our last verse is a interesting on

We will *maybe* finished Jer 6

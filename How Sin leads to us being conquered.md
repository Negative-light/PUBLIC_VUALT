# Review
Last week we looked at the general overview of the book of [[../30-Spiritual/BIBLE_CSB_MD/Jeremiah/Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] and analyized how [[üßëJeremiah]] was called by [[God]] to preach of destruction and rebuilding to the [[Nation of Israel]]. We even analyzed how God overcame Jeremiah's excuse of being young commanding him to not be afraid and giving him the inspiration to do things.

# Today
Today we are going to be looking at the first two things that Jeremiah is called to preach. The first is a prophecy on the coming destruction and the first is the accusation of apostasy of the nation of Israel.

## God is Watching the coming Destruction
The first vision that Jeremiah is called to preach opens with God asking Jeremiah what he sees which  is a almost tree. Now for us this doesn't iftwhat God says next, that he watches over *his word*. This is because the word for almost tree (shaqed)[^cite1] is similar to the word watch over (shaqad) [^cite2].  This vision is God highlighting that he is "awake" or watching to ensures that what he says is accomplished [^b1].

These two verses make me think of a few things. First the best way to make a rule is to make the rule rhyme. Or better put or Rhyming Rules are Remembered Rules. The other side is a tagline. Why does this concept intersect here. Well as we see later God is still working on encouraging Jeremiah [^b2]

[^cite1]: [Strong's Hebrew: 8247. ◊©÷∏◊Å◊ß÷µ◊ì (shaqed) -- almond (tree)](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/8247.htm)
[^cite2]: [Strong's Hebrew: 8245. ◊©÷∏◊Å◊ß÷∑◊ì (shaqad) -- to watch, wake](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/8245.htm)
[^b1]: [Jer 1:11-12](Jer%201.md) - this is a visions that God gives Jeremiah of a almost tree branch
[^b2]: [Jer 1:17-19](Jer%201.md) - this passage is God encouraging Jeremiah that as much as possible to not be intimidated because God is making Jeremiah a Fortress.

## God is Sending Judgment from the North
The second vision is a pot boiling over form north to south. I am certain there is a analogy that makes more sense for us today, but we understand that a boiling post represents damage especially when we consider the experiment in frogs in the boiling pot. [^b3]

[^b3]: [Jer 1:13-16](Jer%201.md) - this is the second vision that Jeremiah sees of a boiling pot talking of the Judgment God is bringing because the nation has run from him. and Into Idolatry

This vision is on how God will be sending [[üèôÔ∏èBabylon]] to attack from the North. But specifically God is going this because the people have fallen into idolatry and sacrificing to them 

# Next Week
I am abandoning the *done in 24* goal... that just isn't happening unless we want to split up more, but there is too much to go over and I would like to give this book the time it deserves.
*IF* we would like to do this we can split up accross chapters and have 4 "mini lessons" it is up to y'all but yeah.

# Review
Last week we looked at the general overview of the book of [[../Jeremiah/Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] and analyzed how [[../p-jeremiah]] was called by [[God]] to preach of destruction and rebuilding to the [[../p-nation-of-israel]]. We even analyzed how God overcame Jeremiah's excuse of being young commanding him to not be afraid and giving him the inspiration to do things.

# Today
Today we are going to be looking at the first two things that Jeremiah is called to preach. The first is a prophecy on the coming destruction and the first is the accusation of apostasy of the nation of Israel.

## God is Watching the coming Destruction
The first vision that Jeremiah is called to preach opens with God asking Jeremiah what he sees which  is a almost tree. Now for us this doesn't if what God says next, that he watches over *his word*. This is because the word for almost tree (shaqed)[^cite1] is similar to the word watch over (shaqad) [^cite2].  This vision is God highlighting that he is "awake" or watching to ensures that what he says is accomplished [^b1].

These two verses make me think of a few things. First the best way to make a rule is to make the rule rhyme. Or better put or Rhyming Rules are Remembered Rules. The other side is a tagline. Why does this concept intersect here. Well as we see later God is still working on encouraging Jeremiah [^b2]

[^cite1]: [Strong's Hebrew: 8247. שָׁקֵד (shaqed) -- almond (tree)](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/8247.htm)
[^cite2]: [Strong's Hebrew: 8245. שָׁקַד (shaqad) -- to watch, wake](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/8245.htm)
[^b1]: [Jer 1:11-12](Jer%201.md) - this is a visions that God gives Jeremiah of a almost tree branch
[^b2]: [Jer 1:17-19](Jer%201.md) - this passage is God encouraging Jeremiah that as much as possible to not be intimidated because God is making Jeremiah a Fortress.

## God is Sending Judgment from the North
The second vision is a pot boiling over form north to south. I am certain there is a analogy that makes more sense for us today, but we understand that a boiling post represents damage especially when we consider the experiment in frogs in the boiling pot. [^b3]

[^b3]: [Jer 1:13-16](Jer%201.md) - this is the second vision that Jeremiah sees of a boiling pot talking of the Judgment God is bringing because the nation has run from him. and Into Idolatry

This vision is on how God will be sending [[🏙️Babylon]] to attack from the North. But specifically God is going this because the people have fallen into idolatry and sacrificing to them.

## God Encouraging Jeremiah
The final part of this vision is that God is encouraging Jeremiah to stand firm and try his best. The first thing God calls Jeremiah is to not be intimidated or to not fall to the pressure of the culture of the day [^cite3] and become "dismayed" or discouraged by what the people will do.
From here God says he has made Jeremiah a set of structures. If we roll this into the concept of Jeremiah being call into Spiritual Warfare, he has become a fortress for God within the society, but lets look futher. He is to call out the government, the church and the culture of his time and place [^b2].

[^cite3]: [Strong's Hebrew: 2865. חָתַת (chathath) -- 51 Occurrences](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/strongs_2865.htm)

## Applications
So of what benefit do we see today from this section. I think this rolls back to first and foremost that God wants us to obey him and to do what he has called us to do, and that what we need is faith.
Was it Jeremiah who was making himself a fortress? **NO**.
How then should we expect that we can become a fortress for God in and of ourselves?
How can we deal with the problems in our culture without having first sought God and we are becoming obedient to **Him**?
How can we expect for God to give us a vision if we are not obisidnet to follow through and **act on that vision**?

# Next Week
I am abandoning the *done in 24* goal... that just isn't happening unless we want to split up more, but there is too much to go over and I would like to give this book the time it deserves.
*IF* we would like to do this we can split up accross chapters and have 4 "mini lessons" it is up to y'all but yeah.

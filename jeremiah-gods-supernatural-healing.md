# Review
We have been in a section talking about how [[God|God]] would restore [[p-nation-of-israel|Israel]] and [[city-jerusalem|Jerusalem]] after their 70 year captivity in [[üèôÔ∏èBabylon|Babylon]]. Last week we specifically look at how God will fully restore the people but for the sake of discipline and that we will understand the why, but it must wait till after that point.
# Lesson
This week a short but powerful section. Here we see God is going to restore the people but also heal them. And that this discipline was also a bit of rest for the people [^1].

Some extra useful data for y'all is that this chapter is considered the climax of Jeremiah and we will see in a future lesson even the idea of the new covenant that we as believers are under [^garner-howes] [^enduring-word] [^ellicott]. But the focus for today is that God will keep his promise at the end of chapter 30 [^ellicott] [^garner-howes] [^john-gill].

## When Are we talking about
So this chapter opens with "At This time" which means when *all of Israel* is unified. This hasn't been completed as there are the "lost tribes" which were the northern tribes that were scattered via [[üìåAssyria|Assyria]]. So zooming out from the last chapter that talks a lot about just the [[Southern Kingdom|Southern Kingdom]]  but all of Israel [^john-gill] [^garner-howes] [^ellicott] [^enduring-word]. 

Of course there is a partial completion with Israel having been returned under [[üßëCyrus|Cyrus]] and under [[üèôÔ∏èRome|Rome]] [^john-calvin] [^matthew-poole]. 

## The Redemption of God
Now we look at the remaining verses which talk about how God will redeem Israel and reminds them of how God saved them from [[üìåEgypt|Egypt]].

- God tells the peole they will have rest after surviving the sword
    - This could be referencing the events of Exodus [^matthew-poole] [^matthew-henry] calling the people to remember God's pattern for mercy [^2]
    - The point  that God's faithfulness should bolster our faith providing hope for a future we do not see [^3]
- God is faithful in his unconditional [[Strongs G26|agap√©]] love.
- God Redemptive healing
    - He emphasizes rebuilding by doubling it up (this was common for the Hebrew language). We might call this revival.
    - The Revirgining Effect. Israel is now pure. There is no more impurity. [^john-gill].
        - This can also be the returning of youthful joy [^matthew-poole] [^john-calvin].
- God makes joy for a brighter future
    - Vineyards take decades to mature. This is long term thinking [^matthew-poole]
    - Note that [[üìåSamaria|Samaria]] which has yet to be returned to Israel showing full restoration [^matthew-henry] [^john-calvin]
    - Literally growing roots and building a society. This is actually how cities formed (even ours) someone plants a field. Someone else does it. Then a market. Then a meeting place and now we have to pay taxes [^john-gill]
    - There is enough peace to make the work worth it.
- Unified National Worship
    - The people will come together and worship.
    - The land of Ephraim was already scattered so this points to full unification. They had become actually anti-Israel [^matthew-henry]
# Applications

## Remember God's Faithfulness
I think that the fist application of this chapter is that we should remember how God has been faithful in our lives and in the lives of those around us.  Remember who God is and what he does bolsters our faith [^matthew-henry]. God starts this section by reminding that he is the God who drew them out of Egypt and he will draw them out of Babylon [^john-calvin] [^matthew-poole].

Somehting to consider is that God even encourages making intentional places to remember is faithfulness such as when Israel first entered the promissed land under [[üßëJoshua son of Nun|Joshua]] [^4] 

## No Limits on Redemption
verse 4 has something i feel we miss so so often in the modern day. God redeems full. I think it is important to remember that God was calling Israel an adulterous people in the beginning in this book. Yet here God says "Virgin Israel" [^1]. Today I think we treat some sins (especially sexual sin) as once tainted always tainted. If you are divorced you are used up. Child out of wedlock, not worthy of celebrating your child's life.

But what does God say. He makes all things new. And every day is a new day you can be redeemed.  Yes, go sin no more. But do not dwell in your sin while obeying dwell on who God is and what he has done. You're identity who you are is something new.

Here I want to remind us and end with the [[Gospel]]. We are sinners in need of a savior. That savior came as a man [[jesus|Jesus Christ]] who died on a cross for our sins. He was raised three days later showing that even death can be conquered. We are called to one thing, to believe that Jesus was  who he said he was (God) and that he died for our sins. Then through the power of the [[Holy Spirit]] we will be made new.

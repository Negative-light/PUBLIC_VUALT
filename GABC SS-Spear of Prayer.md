# Review
We are in a study over spiritual warfare. That is the battle between [[God]] and Satan over glory. We have come to understand that Satan wants to disable Christians such that we cannot bring glory to God.
After analyzing both angles and demons we started to study our authority that God gives us culminating in last weeks study of the [[Armor of God]].
The most important point of our study though is that victory is found in [[../30-Spiritual/33-Resources/33.10-People/ðŸ‘¼Jesus|ðŸ‘¼Jesus]], we already in fact have victory in him and just need to live out our life understanding this despite the deceptions of Satan telling us otherwise.

# Today
Today we are going to talk about prayer, there are multiple analogies that relates prayer to the armor of God. First being the Spear analogy that relates prayer to the Roman spear specifically the `pilum` which was long javelin that was designed to be used as a piercing weapon that was useful in forcing the enemy to abandon or use a significantly weakened shield[^cite1] . The alternative analogy is the "communications" system which highlights that prayer is used as a primary way of getting orders and making requests for support. There is a third introduce that I think is important that is that prayer is a way of life or discipline  that lines you up and "how you get dressed" in spiritual warfare. We will be using all there of these as I think they all have validity, but all break down.

Before we start I think this quote from the opening of this chapter is also rather important.

>  Too many believers parade into church every Sunday and then march home, and the truth of God never really gets into their lives. People like this are no threat to Satan, because he knows they will never use their spiritual weapons against him. The weapons are for show and entertainment only.

## Prayer is a Priority
Prayer itself is something we are called to do throughout the Bible, but when it comes to spritual warfare it is the principle item that we are called to do in all cases [^b1]. Furthermore prayer is one of the primary ways we individually interact with the spiritual world. 

[^b1]: [[Ephes 6|Ephes 6:9-17]] - This is the principle verse for our study. 

## Prayer requires Patience
Looking at prayer as a communication method we must understand a key principle of communication that is all too often forgotten, it is a two way street. It is something that requires us to not only talk to God, but it requires that we listen to him. 

Furthermore prayer being a communication method requires that we acknowledge who we are talking to. Many Christians treat God like a Fairy Godparent (yeah i coulda used Aladdin and Gennies but I like Timmy Turner) he is the God of the universe. This means that we need to acknowledge that God will tell you no, call you to do the hard things etc.

## Prayer holds Power
One example prayer we see is from [[ðŸ§‘Daniel]] seeking God about the [[../p-nation-of-israel]] being set free from their time in captivity. But it is important to understand, Daniel knew the scriptures and thus knew that Israel was due to be set free. But what happens after is that Daniel receives prophecy about the end times and so much more following this [^b2].
Adding onto this I would say that Prayer in general does hold power, just as obedience holds power too for Christians, but the most powerful form of prayer comes from Scripture and having a deep seated knowledge of it. Note that Daniels prayer discuses many topics throughout scripture, but Daniel doesn't precisely quote it. Understand that having knowledge of Scripture is to have it embedded so deep that although you may not be 100% quoting it you are quoting the ideas and core concepts behind it. In essence the Bible has become the backbone of your thinking. [^launchpoint1]

[^b2]: [[Dan 9|Dan 9:1-19]] this is the prayer from Daniel that opens a huge section of prophecy.
[^launchpoint1]: **For Future Study**: Look into writing on [[Mental Back Bones]] and how different topics, ideas and concepts form a skeleton of thinking for the primary brain and second brain.

## Prayer requires Perseverance
IF I were not trying to keep the `Prayer \<phrase\> P\w*` pattern I would have said endurance. But the idea requires the same we are called to pray at all times in all seasons etc [^b3]. The primary issue here is that we are not talking about physical endurance which most people want to tie this too, it is mental endurance. Satan is going to attempt to distract you as much as possible is you are truly deep in prayer, thus you must have endurance.
For the sake of encouragement I also will mention endurance takes time to build up and you should keep track of how well you do. What gets measured and tracked will improve as we humans like to *make number better* as much as possible. This of course comes with the warning that you shouldn't make prayer become just a game or something. This being said I am not a communications expert either so others may be able to provide better data.

[^b3]: [[1 Thess 5|1 Thess 5:17]] - This verse is where we get the call to pray without ceasing. This is in a much larger list of things we are called to.

## Prayer in the *Pneuma*
I am reaching with the headings now. But I think this works. The word there *Pneuma* is the word used for the [[Holy Spirit]] throughout the Scriptures. If we look back at our call in the passage on the armor of God we will see that we are called to "pray in  the Spirit" [^b1].  This is a call to immersion with the Spiritual things  that can only be gained via the Holy Spirit. This requires that we think of Spiritual thoughts [^b4].
The greatest part of this is that when you are beaten down and cannot pray or don't even know what you need to pray for the Holy Spirit interciedes for *you* [^b5].

[^b4]: [[1 Cor 2|1 Cor 2:9013]] - This passage shows us what it means to live in the Spiritual realm specifcly being envelpoed in the Holy Spirit.
[^b5]: [[Rom 8|Rom 8:16-18]]  - in this passage we see that both the Holy Spirit and Jesus intercede for us at the throne of God.
# Next Week
WE are goign to start looking at executing warfare to break strongholds in the four battle fronts of Spiritual life.

# Review
We are in a study over spiritual warfare. That is the battle between [[God]] and Satan over glory. We have come to understand that Satan wants to disable Christians such that we cannot bring glory to God.
After analyzing both angles and demons we started to study our authority that God gives us culminating in last weeks study of the [[Armor of God]].
The most important point of our study though is that victory is found in [[../30-Spiritual/33-Resources/33.10-People/ðŸ‘¼Jesus|ðŸ‘¼Jesus]], we already in fact have victory in him and just need to live out our life understanding this despite the deceptions of Satan telling us otherwise.

# Today
Today we are going to talk about prayer, there are multiple analogies that relates prayer to the armor of God. First being the Spear analogy that relates prayer to the Roman spear specifically the `pilum` which was long javelin that was designed to be used as a piercing weapon that was useful in forcing the enemy to abandon or use a significantly weakened shield[^cite1] . The alternative analogy is the "communications" system which highlights that prayer is used as a primary way of getting orders and making requests for support. There is a third introduce that I think is important that is that prayer is a way of life or discipline  that lines you up and "how you get dressed" in spiritual warfare. We will be using all there of these as I think they all have validity, but all break down.

Before we start I think this quote from the opening of this chapter is also rather important.

>  Too many believers parade into church every Sunday and then march home, and the truth of God never really gets into their lives. People like this are no threat to Satan, because he knows they will never use their spiritual weapons against him. The weapons are for show and entertainment only.

## Prayer is a Priority
Prayer itself is something we are called to do throughout the Bible, but when it comes to spritual warfare it is the principle item that we are called to do in all cases [^b1]. Furthermore prayer is one of the primary ways we individually interact with the spiritual world. 

[^b1]: [[Ephes 6|Ephes 6:9-17]] - This is the principle verse for our study. 

## Prayer requires Patience
Looking at prayer as a communication method we must understand a key principle of communication that is all too often forgotten, it is a two way street. It is something that requires us to not only talk to God, but it requires that we listen to him. 

Furthermore prayer being a communication method requires that we acknowledge who we are talking to. Many Christians treat God like a Fairy Godparent (yeah i coulda used Aladdin and Gennies but I like Timmy Turner) he is the God of the universe. This means that we need to acknowledge that God will tell you no, call you to do the hard things etc.

## Prayer holds Power
One example prayer we see is from Daniel seeking God about the [[Nation of Israel]] being set free from their time in captivity. But it is importnat to understand, Daniel knew the scriptures and thus knew that Isreal was du

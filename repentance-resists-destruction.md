# Review
The Previous studies we have focused on the prophecies of [p-jeremiah](../p-jeremiah.md). We have been highlighting this concept that [[adultery-def|Adultery]] and Apostasy are directly connected. Furthermore we have further discussed how God is faithful to [Israel](../p-nation-of-israel.md) even when they wander.

A key thing to consider as we study is that Israel relates to how the christian life works too.

# This Week
[^b1]: [Jer 4:1-2](Jer%204.md) - This is a call from [God](God.md) for the people to repent and then they will be blessed
[^b2]: [Jer 4:3-4](Jer%204.md) - This is another call for the people to repent and have their hearts be circumsied.
[^b3]: [Rom 2:28-29](Rom%202.md) - this passage talks about how we as Christians are circumsied in the heart.
[^b4]: [James 1:6](James%201.md) - This passage talks about how a doubter is like a ship tossed in the wind
[^b5]: [2 Cor 10:17-18](2%20Cor%2010.md) - this passage calls us to boast only in God
[^c1]: This reminds me of the [Parable of the Sower](Parable%20of%20the%20Sower.md)
[^enduring-word]: [Enduring Word Bible Commentary Jeremiah Chapter 4](https://enduringword.com/bible-commentary/jeremiah-4/) - this is a commentary I used in study of this.
## A Call to Repent
We revised the topic of Repentance with this first call. Here we see that god asks the people to
1. Remove their idols
2. Hold close to the faith in God

This will result with them being blessed [^b1].

Something I think is important here is that the people have pride in God and God alone. This is also something we as Christians are called to do. This ironically helps further the [Gospel](Gospel.md) because it helps in various areas including reducing infighting between ministries [^b5].

Something to consider is that we see a call to now waver here. Really this is a call to not doubt God to seek him faithfully. As Christians we know that a doubter will be like a ship tossed in the wind [^b4]. The same for the call to wisdom is for true repentance. We as Christians cannot fully repent. We can start that process but it is God who gives us the [Faith](Faith.md) to seek him.
### A Further Call to Soften the Heart
The next segment is really is a call for the people of [city-jerusalem](../city-jerusalem.md) to repent by softening the heart to God. From breaking up ground that is hardened and difficult to plow and evading thrones [^enduring-word] [^c1]. 
This also is to see k a change in the heart rather than the flesh ie a circumcision of the heart [^b2]. We know that this is a source of pride for the Jewish people as later we see the Jedizers also impressing that one must be *physically* circumsied to be saved [^b3].

# Next Week
Next week we are going to focus on the coming judgment to Jerusalem.

## A Search For Righteousness
The fist part of this chapter is this search for righteous people throughout [city-jerusalem](../city-jerusalem.md). This shows up that the people are fully unrighteous on all levels ultimately leading to God calling for their judgment [^m1]. This is possibly related them having plenty and thus not seeking God, at least according to Ellicott [^ellicott]. Others pull from the punishment section to highlight that this deviance shows ingratitude to God [^david-guzik].

### Applications

> [!TIP]
> How has God been good to you?
>     Do you live a life in such a way that this is shown?


## God is the Judge
We once again have a section on God bringing Judgment using [🏙️Babylon](%F0%9F%8F%99%EF%B8%8FBabylon.md) [^m3] this being said God also desires to have grace on the people [^matthew-henry]. A interesting point highlighted by John Gill also ties this into judgments from Leviticus [^b1], [^john-gill].

### Applications
>[!TIP]
>Do you, when being disciplined remember that God has a plan for it?


## God Will Restore
This section is God's carge against the people. They have become evil [^m6] This area shows that the people are resuing humility etc [^matthew-henry]

# Last Week
Ok last week we were looking at how [[p-jeremiah|Jeremiah]] and [[🧑Hezekiah|Hezekiah]]  responded to persecution. Jeremiah had faith that [[God|God]] would protect him while Hezekiah attempted to flee and lost. This showed us as future leaders of the church body that we should seek faith over fear. The response of the Jewish leaders showed us that knowledge of God doesn't mean wisdom to repent. 

# This Week
This chapter we see one idea shared to both the nations around the [[Southern Kingdom]] then to [[🧑Zedekiah|Zedekiah]] and finally the [[Tribe of Levi|Levites]]. It is the same motif. Submit to [[🏙️Babylon|Babylon]] to reduce suffering of your people, do not listen to your prophets. This is all done using a yoke as an object lesson and prompt to "put on the yoke" of Babylon [^1].



> Some manuscripts have verse 1 saying that Jeremiah received this command under [[🧑Jehoiakim|Jehoiakim]]. But either way this prophecy was clearly meant for Zedekiah [^garner-howes] [^ellicott]. Some translations only leave this as a footnote such as the CSB.

The events here probably happened around 15 years after chapter 26. During the interim [[🧑Jehoiachin|Jehoiachin]] would have been carried off to Babylon and some of the temple and palaces wealth would have gone as well and Jehoiakim would have passed [^ellicott] [^matthew-henry]
## For Everybody
The initial prompt goes to "the world" taking advantage of messengers (who may have been bringing news of Babylon) who were coming to Jerusalem. Jeremiah wearing a yoke was a clear symbol of course of this. Yokes being a farm tool are still tied to servitude (possibly due to scripture) [^1]. The point here and through the rest of the chapter is that Babylon is going to win the war. And the current plotting to rebel against Babylon is why God is sending this warning [^enduring-word] [^garner-howes].  Furthermore by fighting the rule of Babylon they are fighting God [^john-calvin] and will get a much higher punishment. The opposite is also true. God is giving them an opportunity to quickly submit and promises them to be able to return to their land, they will not loose everything [^garner-howes]. This would begin their submission to God by them submitting to God's providential power [^matthew-henry]

## For Israel
Now Jeremiah gives word to the king of Judah. Who doesn't listen but the point is that if you submit now you and those under you will suffer less. we as leaders should understand that sometimes a hard choice is temporary pain for long term health. An example that can be used today is if the leaders of our nation were given an opportunity to fully pay off our national debt. It will be painful for all of the nation for a time (probably a decade plus), but it would relative ties that we have to other nations and boost the future health of the nation. Zedekiah is given the same lesson here by having the opportunity. Pay off the spiritual debt of the nation by submitting and the transfer to exile would be easier (maybe the exile would be easier) and eventually things will return to normal.

## For the Levites
Here i wanted to focus on the motif of evading the false hope from false prophets. This was given to the world as well, but I felt the Priests were more effective. They had lost the wealth of their profession. Showing that God was not with them at this point. Like any bad time false prophets are of course thriving and taking advantage of the moment [^enduring-word]. Of course these people were concerned because the utility items for doing worship were stolen [^matthew-poole] just a few years prior. This would be like someone coming and torching the sanctuary of the church .It would create grief in us. And sadly there would be snakes in the grass trying to take advantage and give us a false hope. It is the same with God. Jeremiah tells them things will get worse before they are better, but that God will restore what is ours. I will talk about the more momentarily.

## Applications

### God is Sovereign 

God is ruler of all and chooses the powers that be. He has a use for them etc. [^garner-howes] [^ellicott] [^enduring-word]. I think this is interesting. While writing this study i was listening to music and the song "the ride of my life" came on. This was a new version of the song (I prefer Sam Bowman's solo) but at the end it talks about how we cannot skip the "hard part" of life. I would suggest a listen [^2].

### Quick Submission --> Quick Healing

We see God offer two directions. Submit to judgment quickly and start healing or Refuse judgment and suffer. In the case faced by the nations in our passage this was literal life and death. And we see God really is wanting people to make this choice by the rhetorical question given to Zedekiah. The Garner Howes Commentary provides a good quote on this:

> It really does not make sense to commit suicide by insisting on having one's own way.
\- Garner Howes Commentary [^garner-howes]

Your refusal to submit to God's correction is really like this. It may not be physical suicide but it is quenching the spirit. It is a spiritual suicide where you are now rejecting the "abundant life" that God gives us as believers.

### Watch Who You Listen To
The final element that God points out repeatedly here is that false prophets should be avoided. I think we know that but in a day and age filled with positive messages and this "everything is gonna be good" culture we should be far more careful.

# Next Week
We gonna be doing all of chapter 28.

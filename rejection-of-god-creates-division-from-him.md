# Review
We are looking at the book from the prophet [ðŸ§‘Jeremiah](%F0%9F%A7%91Jeremiah.md). This study highlights the sin of the southern kingdom of the [Nation of Israel](Nation%20of%20Israel.md). Who have abandoned [God](God.md) and have gone to false god's and have come to rely on neighboring nations for protection. Withing this study we have noticed this trend in Jeremiah that 

# This Week
This we continue the same ideas of God calling the people to repentance.

## God Attempts to Call them Back
As we start up we see the idea of the people trying to bring a case against God, paralleling earlier in this section [^b1]. This is overall because as we shall see in this prophecy that God is making life dificult for them to see if they will turn to him.

[^b1]: [Jer 2:9,29](Jer%202.md) - these two verses are where we see this calling to court the first from God the second from the people.

### God's Attempts to Reach out
The first thing God does against the people is attack the children of the people. But this was 'in vain'. This in vain idea really is that God desired for them to repent, and they did not [^b2].

Next God sent prophets which they killed. I find this interesting because [ðŸ‘¼Jesus](%F0%9F%91%BCJesus.md) later uses this to charge the people [^b3]. But these people had not only killed God's prophets they killed them like a Lion [^b2].

[^b2]: [Jer 2:30](Jer%202.md) - This verse we see God's two attempts to reach out to the people who then reject him.
[^b3]: [Matt 23:29-31](Matt%2023.md) - here we see Jesus' charge against the [Pharisees](Pharisees.md)

### God's Charge
From here we see God charge the people with being evil seeking to go away from him. This is God highlighting their pride in their own power [^b4] [^cite1]

[^b4]: [Jer 2:31](Jer%202.md) - here we see God callign the people evil for their pride
[^cite1]: [Enduring Word Bible Commentary Jeremiah Chapter 2](https://enduringword.com/bible-commentary/jeremiah-2/) - this is the commentary that highlights the charge of God calling the peoples pride strong.

# Review
We are looking at the book from the prophet [p-jeremiah](../p-jeremiah.md). This study highlights the sin of the southern kingdom of the [p-nation-of-israel](../p-nation-of-israel.md). Who have abandoned [God](God.md) and have gone to false god's and have come to rely on neighboring nations for protection. Withing this study we have noticed this trend in Jeremiah that 

# This Week
This we continue the same ideas of God calling the people to repentance.

## God Attempts to Call them Back
As we start up we see the idea of the people trying to bring a case against God, paralleling earlier in this section [^b1]. This is overall because as we shall see in this prophecy that God is making life difficult for them to see if they will turn to him.

[^b1]: [Jer 2:9,29](Jer%202.md) - these two verses are where we see this calling to court the first from God the second from the people.

### God's Attempts to Reach out
The first thing God does against the people is attack the children of the people. But this was 'in vain'. This in vain idea really is that God desired for them to repent, and they did not [^b2].

Next God sent prophets which they killed. I find this interesting because [jesus](jesus.md) later uses this to charge the people [^b3]. But these people had not only killed God's prophets they killed them like a Lion [^b2].

[^b2]: [Jer 2:30](Jer%202.md) - This verse we see God's two attempts to reach out to the people who then reject him.
[^b3]: [Matt 23:29-31](Matt%2023.md) - here we see Jesus' charge against the [Pharisees](Pharisees.md)

### God's Charge
From here we see God charge the people with being evil seeking to go away from him. This is God highlighting their pride in their own power [^cite1]. God consists this action with how a woman would keep their wedding ring and how crazy it is yet Israel did it [^b4]

[^b4]: [Jer 2:31-32](Jer%202.md) - here we see God calling the people evil for their pride
[^cite1]: [Enduring Word Bible Commentary Jeremiah Chapter 2](https://enduringword.com/bible-commentary/jeremiah-2/) - this is the commentary that highlights the charge of God calling the peoples pride strong.

## Israel Is Guilty and Cannot Hide
The next two verse God highlights the wickedness of Israel. Here we see that their Garments are covered in wickedness. This is highlighting that they are not only guilty but it is public, it is no longer hidden sin [^cite1]. But something I think is important as this is a common theme for a nation that has fallen from God, the poor are mistreated and/or killed. this is honestly a theme i have been picking up on. In a righteous nation that seeks God the poor will be taken care of, because the people care [^b5].

[^b5]: [Jer 2:34](Jer%202.md) - this verse is where we see God highlighting Israel's guilt

Within this next point we  see that Israel now claims innocence and thus shouldn't be judged. This is a lack of repentance, the people get stuck in their mind. Matthew Henry mentions that this might have also encouraged their sin pushing the people to ultimately be judged [^cite2].  Ultimately God will judge the people because they have not only become corrupt they have refused repentance [^b6].

[^cite2]: [Commentary on Jeremiah 2 by Matthew Henry](https://www.blueletterbible.org/Comm/mhc/Jer/Jer_002.cfm) - this is a commentary used in this study
[^b6]: [Jer 2:34](Jer%202.md) - this verse we see Israel claiming innocence and God saying he will judge them

## Israel is a Wandering Ship doomed for Destruction
Israel is then called unstable by God, this is specifically talking about Israel's political scene [^cite2]. This reminded me of how a Christian without faith will become double minded and tossed about doctrinally like a ship in the wind [^b7]. For Israel this would result in them being captured and "put to shame" [^b8]

[^b7]: [James 1:5-8](James%201.md) - here we see the promise of God to give Christians wisdom if we ask in [Faith](Faith.md), but if we lack faith and doubt we become a ship tossed in the wind
[^b8]: [Jer 2:36](Jer%202.md) - here we see that Israel is unstable and will be put to shame

This ends with the bleak statement that Israel will be judged and they will not succeed. Because they have rejected God [^b9]. This contrasts the initial promise to Israel when they interested Israel that God would be with and behind Israel [^b10].

[^b9]: [Jer 2:27](Jer%202.md) - here we see Israel's final judgment
[^b10]: [Josh 1:9](Josh%201.md) - here we see God's promise to be with t he people of Isreal

# Next Week
We are going to dive further into  the cost that Israel has incurred due to their apostasy

# Last Week
Last week we looked at [Jeremiah](p-jeremiah.md)'s prophecy to the [Northern Kingdom](Northern%20Kingdom.md) that [Babylon](%F0%9F%8F%99%EF%B8%8FBabylon.md) was coming and that the judgment is set. 

We then took on to consider what this discuses for leadership, how we should take care of those under us. 

# This Week
So this week we look at the leadership of the nation specifically the kids of [Josiah](%F0%9F%A7%91Josiah.md). These being [Jehoahaz](%F0%9F%A7%91jehoahaz.md), [Jehoiakim](%F0%9F%A7%91Jehoiakim.md), and Jehoiakim's son Coniah. Something that is important is that Jeremiah was especially told to go into the throne room (well palace but I am going to hope this assumption is safe) and tell the king.

## To The Crown
The first section God is talking generally to the crown of Israel [^1]. 
We see again the problem of Justice appear here. 
In the zone of leadership don't ya think that is important to God. Yes this addresses the Government but that includes stuff in the church. If we as leaders in our church (independent of if you stay at this church) are to bring glory to God then should not justice and righteousness be priorities in our life?
I think so.

Of course these people (not just the kings but their officers). [God](God.md) marks them for destruction because they won't seek justice and righteousness.

### Applications
As leaders we should avoid the failings of these kingdoms. How can we in our church address justice, righteousness and caring for the vulnerable?
    - What do you think is included in the vulnerable?
        - *Personal Answer*: I think we often limit the term vulnerable to just the economic area. This is not to say that the poor are not vulnerable, they are and that cannot nor should not be denied. But what about those that are emotionally vulnerable due to past traumas. those that are mentally vulnerable due to unique problems in their life. To the spiritually vulnerable, the ones deceived by bad teachings both in this church and abroad. I don't think everyone can care for all the vulnerable in their life. I don't think every church can help with every case. But I do think we can cover as much as possible. I will say that my church cannot take care of those who have been through or deal with divorce, that is very apparent. 

## To the Children of David
The remaining portion of the chapter God directly addresses the specific people [^2]. There is a few important elements here to mention. These kings were actually vassals of Egypt after Josiah was killed by them. But Zedekiah was a vassal of Babylon [^enduring-word].

### For Shallum
The first son addressed is Shallum also known as JEHOAHAZ who was killed by the Pharaoh and was taken to [Egypt](%F0%9F%93%8CEgypt.md) . This is interesting because he also was setup as the leader by Egypt  (or was at least supported by them to be king) but only ran things for ~3 months [^garner-howes] [^note1]. Something to note is that Shallum was the first successor to the thrown despite being Josiah's fourth child [^3]. It is also to consider why God had Jeremiah use this kings given name rather than kingly name, I would surmise this could also be in relation to the names meanings the kingly meaning that God would sustain while the original means retribution [^ellicott].

The judgment for Shallum had already taken place as he would die in Egypt with a dishonorable death as contrasted to his father. I am not sure the reason to take him into captivity

### For Jehoiakim
Jehoiakim is is then brought out as being a unrighteousness king. Spicily this contrasts him with his father [^enduring-word]. This again continues the theme of the first section. But comes with a judgment on Jehoiakim. He was a vassal to Egypt and forced the people to do hard labor, this was to send taxes out to Egypt [^enduring-word]. All while he was lavishing himself and living greatly this once again is counter to what his father did [^matthew-henry]

### For Coniah
Coniah was the young son of Jehoiakim and was also known as [Jehoiachin](%F0%9F%A7%91Jehoiachin.md) [^garner-howes]. He would only result for a few month before being replaced by Another Zedekiah (not the one motioned previously) and this would being the state where Israel is under Babylon.

## Disobedience
In looking through this chapter the habit of disobedience which defied the [Davidic Covenant](Davidic%20Covenant.md) that these people would continue the godliness of [David](%F0%9F%A7%91David.md) [^matthew-poole] but they instead simply excuse for their sin. Although their line was privileged by God they shouldn't have taken it for grated and that they would and could still be judged for this disobedience [^john-calvin] [^john-gill]. 


## Application Questions
- How does this apply do us in our church Today? (Read 3-5)
    - What does seeking Justice and Righteousness look like in the Church?
        - Seek, Justice Love Mercy and Walk humbly [^4]
        - To have Agape for each other [^5]
- We know that these peoples legacy would be destroyed. This has been a running theme of Jeremiah. 
    - Should we seek to redeem people's legacy?
        -  Given that ultimately Jesus would come these people's legacy wasn't completely destroyed, but in their time they were not known for being Good and they are not remembered for the sake of Christ
    - How could you create  a legacy that is worth morning (this is based on the mourning for Josiah)?

# Next Week
Into chapter 23, I may split it at verse 9 but will reach out next week. Please review the full chapter. Something fun here we get to start talking about [Jesus](Jesus.md)!

[^1]: [Jer 22:1-9](Jer%2022.md)
[^2]: [Jer 22:10-30](Jer%2022.md)
[^3]: [1 Chron 3:15](1%20Chron%203.md)
[^note1]: **NOTE**: Although Garner Howes mentions this I have not seem much corroborating evidence for this, but it would rightly explain the messed up succession line.

# Last Week
Ok Last week we focused on Christmas and this week we are going to be returing to [[God]]'s judgment on idolatry and hitting on that a lot of misconceptions about "Christmas is Pagan" believers.

# This Week
So we are mostly going t obe diving into peoples claims that I have seen out in the wild about Christmas. But before we start I want to ask some questions and you to write down your answers.

## The Questions
Do you think a majority of Christmas traditions are based on pagan myths?
Do you think that God is prescriptive or descriptive about worship in the Bible?
    Descriptive worship - God describes how worship is conducted during times throughout the Bible
     Prescriptive Worship - God sets a standard from worship and anything outside of that standard is sin
 What do you think about telling kids about Santa? Should we treat Santa as a myth similar to Jack Frost? Should we focus on the real person behind Santa?

## Is Christmas even allowable?
One argument I have seen from "faithful" people is that we should only keep the feasts/celebrations that are prescribed in the Bible such as the Passover, Feat of Booths etc. When planning this out I began to ask questions about this and truthfully at first I was about to side with them until I noticed that [Jesus](33.10-People/jesus.md) celebrated Hanukkah also known as the Feast of Dedication [^b1]. This celebration was not described in scripture rather it is a celebration of a rebellion lead by Judah Maccabee and a miracle related to the lamp oil to cleans the temple [^cite1]

Why is this important? Simple this disproves the argument that any celebration not found in scripture is "evil" and should not be celebrated. Our own savior joined in the cultural celebration of the day and used it as a method to share the [Gospel](Gospel.md) and show his own divinity [^b2].

[^b1]: [John 10:22-23](John%2010.md)

[^b2]: [John 10:25-30](John%2010.md)


## Are Christmas Traditions Pagan
For most of this section I am using a video from [Inspiring Philosophy](https://www.youtube.com/@InspiringPhilosophy) as this guy has done a good job of catalyzing many of these arguments [^ip-christmas-is-not-pagan] Last week we spent a significant amount of time debunking the idea that the Bible forbids Christmas tree based on our passage for the week [^b3]. Here we find that this passage is describing the creation of idols via fine craftsmanship.

A core premise of many of these arguments we are going to see one common thread. That because a pagan group used this object it is therefore evil. I will not that this would mean that many of our traditions fit this category as pagan groups have used candles, vases and many other implements that we use every day. The truth is these simple similarities are not going to be enough to show that God would forbid the celebration of the most important birth in the universe. 

Now we dive into history and again IP has made a good video on the topic [^ip-christmas-is-not-pagan2]. Ironically I am so used to using this video my previous paragraph mentions exactly what he talks about in the intro. The main idea that we hit is that people target that Christmas was a  reclamation of a pagan holiday namely "Sol Invictus". This celebration wasn't dated till well after Christians started celebrating Christmas on Dec 25th. This leads us to two possibilities
1. That Christians chose Dec 25th to reclaim Sol Invictus
2. The emperor set the day of the holiday to compete with the growing Christian problem
It is this second option that historians believe is more likely.

Other holidays such as Saturnalia or Brumalia are claims people will make but this often happened mid December or began in November ending in mid December.

So how did we get this day? Christians believe Jesus died on the day of his conception placing his birth around this time. This is probably not factual but is a reasonable explanation.

Now the Christmas tree is a bit more complicated because there are a number of examples. The closest to paganism is when Saint Boniface cut a Oak tree dedicated to Thor, then dedicated a evergreen to Christ. Other traditions tie this to Martin Luther and still others tie it to Paradise Trees which were used in a Adam and Eve play that would be done on Christmas Eve. The thing is all of these would have started around 1500 AD while most pagan traditions are gone around 1000 AD. This shows that these are probably not related. The goal of the Christmas tree was probably to bring in hope during the dark and deadly winters.

The final idea is that it comes down the the meaning of a symbol and not the symbol itself that is the problem. Any symbol can be evil or good it is the moral character of those who use it that makes it good or evil. Yeah we shouldn't use a symbol of Satanism today because that is used for Satanism but in a thousand years when our cultures are dead the same symbol may be used for hospitals or something similar that is used to share the glory of God.

## Are we off Track with Christmas
Now I think we should take a moment and look at our modern Christmas traditions and ask if we are off track. This is always wise because it is easy to fall off the narrow way.

### Christmas as  Materialism
Has Christmas become over materialistic. IN the non-Christian world I think that is a easy *yes*. I think for us, this is something that we need to analyze and watch our hearts. It is about our motive. So I think it is important to ask *Why*? behind all these things similar to the purpose of the feasts in [Israel](../p-nation-of-israel.md)'s times.

### Christmas as Monotony
Another problem that honestly does infect the Church is that we have made Christmas monotonous. Ironically for our church today we are breaking that and we should do that more as most things become monotonous when we do not consume intentionally or act with reason.

This is an issue I recently considered of if Man just becomes a machine [^internal-cite]. And We are if we stop our soul and just act without though or intention. This is very easy especially today where we are desired to be factories to produce goods.

[^internal-cite]: [is-man-just-a-machine](is-man-just-a-machine.md)

## The Conclusion
The point of scripture is Christ, all time points to Christ. Thus it isn't bad to have a day to remember his birth. Remembrance is a virtue that God commands throughout scripture [^memory-stones]. Although these memory stones were a physical others were meta-physical ie the feasts. These were used to remember and celebrate the good that our God has done. Ultimately it is about your heart and focusing on the reason for why we celebrate and from that you heart may overflow with the joy of our God.

[^memory-stones]: [Josh 4:1-24](Josh%204.md), [Exod 24:4](Exod%2024.md), [Deut 27:1-8](Deut%2027.md), [Josh 22:9-12](Josh%2022.md), [1 Sam 7:12](1%20Sam%207.md)

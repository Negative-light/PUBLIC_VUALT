# Review
Last weeks lesson was focused on [God](God.md) futher providing a chance and call for [Israel](../%F0%9F%8F%99%EF%B8%8F%F0%9F%8F%99%EF%B8%8FNation%20of%20Israel.md) to repent and return to Him.
- This section did highlight htat the time was coming *quickly* and would be *unavoidable*
- Furthermore there is a break for [ðŸ§‘Jeremiah](%F0%9F%A7%91Jeremiah.md) to call out to God out of being disheartened based on how *people* could reacted

This chapter we are studying the first full lament in this passage. This is one of the reasons Jeremiah is known as the weeping Prophet.  Further we see more of HOW God will judge.

## The Lament
Jeremiah's Lament is rather basic focusing on the coming charge which is mentioned in the previous study as a possible vision that Jeremiah had [^m1]. This also could highlight that Jeremiah was having the repentant hearth for the sake of his own people [^constables]. 

## Depth of Destruction
This next section talks about how the people do not know God and how deep the destruction comes [^m2]. This destruction harkens back to creation [^b1] where the world was formless. The destruction coming from Jeremiah's eyes was SO powerful it essentially was a "hard reset" of the world. Which though this didn't happen immediately we do see that later [^b2].  

I will note that verse 22 is actually from God himself we see this from the phrase "They do not know me". This even calls how they were conducting evil as skilled. They were experts in doing that which was wrong. This could be a intentional rejection of God that results in ignorance [^enduring-word]. 
# Next Week

# Review
Last weeks lesson was focused on [God](God.md) futher providing a chance and call for [Israel](../%F0%9F%8F%99%EF%B8%8F%F0%9F%8F%99%EF%B8%8FNation%20of%20Israel.md) to repent and return to Him.
- This section did highlight that the time was coming *quickly* and would be *unavoidable*
- Furthermore there is a break for [ðŸ§‘Jeremiah](%F0%9F%A7%91Jeremiah.md) to call out to God out of being disheartened based on how *people* could reacted

This chapter we are studying the first full lament in this Jeremiah. This is one of the reasons Jeremiah is known as the weeping Prophet.  Further we see more of HOW God will judge.

## The Lament
Jeremiah's Lament is rather basic focusing on the coming charge which is mentioned in the previous study as a possible vision that Jeremiah had [^m1]. This also could highlight that Jeremiah was having the repentant hearth for the sake of his own people [^constables]. A key is that is sorrows over the destruction despite knowing the depth of the sin of his people, and knowing the grace God has shown.

### Applications
> [!TIP]
> Do we feel compasion for those that are being judged? For those around us?

## Depth of Destruction
This next section talks about how the people do not know God and how deep the destruction comes [^m2]. This destruction harkens back to creation [^b1] where the world was formless. The destruction coming from Jeremiah's eyes was SO powerful it essentially was a "hard reset" of the world. Which though this didn't happen immediately we do see that later [^b2].  

I will note that verse 22 is actually from God himself we see this from the phrase "They do not know me". This even calls how they were conducting evil as skilled. They were experts in doing that which was wrong. This could be a intentional rejection of God that results in ignorance [^enduring-word]. 

### Applications
>[!TIP]
>Have we become "skilled in evil"?
>Are there places where you see judgment in your own life because of this?


## God's Statement
Here we get right back to prophecy and this one has a interesting nugget. God is highlighting that the punishment **will be temporary** [^m3]. This focuses that God doesn't give up on his covenants [^clarks-commentary] holding back the power He *could* bring and the grace he shows trying to correct his people [^coffman].

### Applications
>[!TIP]
>In the places where *you* are being judged, how has God showed grace to you?
>In places where *others* are in judgment, how can you take part in God's work toward judgment

## Running, Bribing, and Hiding. **IT** will not work
This final segment is God talking about how the attempts to hide or bribe or run will not stop the judgment [^m4]. This includes the more comment imagery of judgment being like a woman's labor. This is to focus on how hopeless the situation is [^blue-letter-bible]. This is a unstoping train.

I feel this ties into other prophecies ties into how the world that it groans in child birth [^b3].

### Applications
>[!TIP]
>Given that we know we  cannot hide sin from God are there places where we are attempting to hide from God and really just *slightly* delaying the consequences of our sin?
